The O
bread B
is O
top O
notch O
as O
well O

I O
have O
to O
say O
they O
have O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
delivery B
times I
in O
the O
city O

Food B
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
hot- O
ready O
to O
eat O

Did O
I O
mention O
that O
the O
coffee B
is O
OUTSTANDING O

Certainly O
not O
the O
best O
sushi B
in O
New O
York O
however O
it O
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
place B
is O
very O
clean O
sterile O

I O
trust O
the O
people B
at O
Go O
Sushi O
it O
never O
disappoints O

Straight-forward O
no O
surprises O
very O
decent O
Japanese B
food I

BEST O
spicy B
tuna I
roll I
great O
asian B
salad I

Try O
the O
rose B
roll I
not O
on O
menu B

I O
love O
the O
drinks B
esp O
lychee B
martini I
and O
the O
food B
is O
also O
VERY O
good O

In O
fact O
this O
was O
not O
a O
Nicoise B
salad I
and O
was O
barely O
eatable O

While O
there's O
a O
decent O
menu B
it O
shouldn't O
take O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
your O
drinks B
and O
45 O
for O
a O
dessert B
pizza I

Once O
we O
sailed O
the O
top-notch O
food B
and O
live B
entertainment I
sold O
us O
on O
a O
unforgettable O
evening O

Our O
waiter B
was O
horrible; O
so O
rude O
and O
disinterested O

The O
sangria's O
- O
watered O
down O

menu B
- O
uneventful O
small O

Anytime O
and O
everytime O
I O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Sushi O
Rose O
for O
fresh O
sushi B
and O
great O
portions B
all O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B

Great O
food B
but O
the O
service B
was O
dreadful O

The O
portions B
of I
the I
food I
that O
came O
out O
were O
mediocre O

the O
two O
waitress's B
looked O
like O
they O
had O
been O
sucking O
on O
lemons O

From O
the O
beginning O
we O
were O
met O
by O
friendly O
staff B
memebers I
and O
the O
convienent O
parking B
at O
Chelsea O
Piers O
made O
it O
easy O
for O
us O
to O
get O
to O
the O
boat O

We O
enjoyed O
ourselves O
thoroughly O
and O
will O
be O
going O
back O
for O
the O
desserts B
 
Desserts B
are O
almost O
incredible: O
my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
their O
Tart B
of I
the I
Day I

I O
am O
surprised O
at O
the O
lower O
reviews O
because O
it O
is O
definitely O
better O
than O
other O
places O
I O
have O
tried O
with O
higher O
ratings O

Maybe O
the O
secret O
was O
that O
we O
went O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
and O
everything O
was O
great O

The O
food B
was O
extremely O
tasty O
creatively O
presented O
and O
the O
wine B
excellent O

WE O
ENDED O
UP O
IN O
LITTLE O
ITALY O
IN O
LATE O
AFTERNOON O

WE O
WERE O
PLEASANTLY O
SURPRISED O
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O

THE O
LASAGNA B
WAS O
PROBABLY O
THE O
BEST O
I O
HAVE O
TASTED O

Harumi O
Sushi O
has O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
delicious O
array B
of I
sushi I
in O
NYC O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
not O
just O
its O
superb O
cuisine B
but O
also O
for O
its O
friendly O
owners B
and O
staff B

If O
you're O
craving O
some O
serious O
indian B
food I
and O
desire O
a O
cozy O
ambiance B
this O
is O
quite O
and O
exquisite O
choice O

I O
definitely O
enjoyed O
the O
food B
as O
well O

have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
here O

It O
was O
pleasantly O
uncrowded O
the O
service B
was O
delightful O
the O
garden B
adorable O
the O
food B
from O
appetizers B
to O
entrees B
was O
delectable O

You O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
experience O

The O
food B
is O
surprisingly O
good O
and O
the O
decor B
is O
nice O

How O
pretentious O
and O
inappropriate O
for O
MJ O
Grill O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
provides O
power O
lunch B
and O
dinners B

Two O
wasted O
steaks B
-- O
what O
a O
crime O

The O
staff B
should O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly O

I O
absolutely O
suggest O
this O
place O

I O
think O
the O
meatball B
parm I
is O
good O

If O
you O
want O
good O
tasting O
well O
seasoned O
latin B
food I
eat O
at O
Cabana O
and O
you O
can't O
go O
wrong O

Definitely O
try O
the O
taglierini B
with I
truffles I
- O
it O
was O
incredible O

Also O
the O
staff B
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
really O
personable O

Overall O
this O
is O
a O
great O
new O
restaurant O
that O
has O
been O
consistently O
good O
every O
time O
I O
have O
been O

The O
gnocchi B
literally O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O

Had O
a O
great O
experience O
at O
Trio O
 staff B
was O
pleasant; O
food B
was O
tasty O
and O
large O
in O
portion B
size I
- O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
the O
portobello/gorgonzola/sausage B
appetizer I
and O
the O
lobster B
risotto I

Entrees B
include O
classics O
like O
lasagna B
fettuccine B
Alfredo I
and O
chicken B
parmigiana I

The O
food B
is O
good O
the O
teriyaki B
I O
recommend O

Meal B
was O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O

Try O
the O
Peanut B
Butter I
Sorbet I
and O
the O
pizza B
with I
soy I
cheese I

Good O
food B
at O
the O
right O
price B
what O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O

We O
love O
it O
and O
took O
buses O
and O
cabs O
to O
get O
there O

If O
you' O
re O
in O
New O
York O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
miss O
this O
place O

The O
food B
is O
top O
notch O
the O
service B
is O
attentive O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
great O

I've O
been O
coming O
here O
on O
and O
off O
for O
the O
past O
five O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
La O
Lanterna O
has O
never O
ever O
dissapointed O
me O

Great O
food B
great O
waitstaff B
great O
atmosphere B
and O
best O
of O
all O
GREAT O
beer B

this O
is O
still O
one O
of O
my O
most O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
area O
the O
food B
is O
inexpensive O
but O
very O
good O
kimono B
shrimp I
special I
was O
excellent O
and O
has O
a O
great O
atmosphere B

My O
husband O
and O
I O
moved O
to O
Nolita O
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
for O
as O
long O
as O
we O
have O
lived O
here O
Peasant O
has O
been O
our O
favorite O

The O
whole O
experience O
was O
satisfying O

However O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
visit O

The O
menu B
is O
interesting O
and O
quite O
reasonably O
priced B

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
and O
clearly O
fresh O
ingredients B
were O
used O

This O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
the O
food B
wasn't O
cooked O
fresh; O
it O
was O
obviously O
made O
before O
hand O
and O
then O
reheated O

Appetizer B
are O
excellent O
here; O
you O
can O
make O
a O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
meal B
out O
of O
them O

The O
spicy B
mussels I
are O
a O
highlight O

Also O
get O
the O
Onion B
Rings I
-- O
best O
we've O
ever O
had O

Would O
not O
return O
for O
the O
amount O
we O
paid O

However O
being O
foodies O
we O
were O
utterly O
disappointed O
with O
the O
food B

Huge O
portions B
great O
and O
attentive O
service B
and O
pretty O
good O
prices B

I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
their O
service B
and O
food B

I O
complained O
to O
the O
waiter B
and O
then O
to O
the O
manager B
but O
the O
intensity O
of O
rudeness O
from O
them O
just O
went O
up O

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
milkshakes B
are O
even O
better O

Stay O
away O
if O
you're O
claustrophobic O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
'hood O
definitely O
stop O
in O

the O
mushroom B
barley I
soup I
is O
amazing O

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
I O
checked O
out O
Arezzo O
with O
my O
wife O

I'm O
glad O
I O
did O
as O
the O
food B
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
staff B
was O
friendly O
courteous O
and O
efficient O

Their O
duck B
here O
is O
also O
absolutely O
delicious O

This O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
come O
back O
to O
over O
the O
years O

While O
it O
was O
large O
and O
a O
bit O
noisy O
the O
drinks B
were O
fantastic O
and O
the O
food B
was O
superb O

One O
caveat: O
Some O
of O
the O
curried B
casseroles I
can O
be O
a O
trifle O
harsh O

I O
wasn't O
impressed O
and O
it O
wasn't O
SPICEY O

The O
food B
was O
almost O
always O
EXCELLENT O

I O
was O
pleasently O
surprised O
at O
the O
taste B

A O
nice O
space B
as O
long O
as O
it O
doesn't O
get O
too O
crowded O
and O
a O
singleminded O
devotion O
to O
its O
chosen O
cuisine B
make O
Mare O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
seafood B
lovers O

I O
never O
had O
an O
orange B
donut I
before O
so O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O

they O
really O
provide O
a O
relaxing O
laid-back O
atmosphere B

This O
particular O
location O
certainly O
uses O
substandard O
meats B

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
resteraunt O
on O
my O
way O
home O
from O
the O
subway O

The O
Management B
was O
less O
than O
accomodating O

The O
ambience B
is O
also O
more O
laid-back O
and O
relaxed O

the O
teas B
are O
great O
and O
all O
the O
sweets B
are O
homemade O

mojitos B
and O
the O
service B
are O
the O
best O
part O
in O
there O

Sandwiches B
burgers B
and O
salads B
like O
the O
lemon-dressed B
cobb I
are O
classic O
successes O

this O
restaurant O
is O
absolutely O
beautiful O

The O
design B
is O
very O
intimate O
and O
romantic O

The O
food B
was O
wonderful O
and O
imaginative O

The O
staff B
is O
very O
sharp O
and O
they O
look O
good O
too O

The O
worst O
though O
was O
the O
taste B

They O
were O
dry O
stale O
and O
pretty O
flavorless O

The O
fajita B
we O
tried O
was O
tasteless O
and O
burned O
and O
the O
mole B
sauce I
was O
way O
too O
sweet O

Stay O
with O
the O
roasted B
chickens I
and O
you'll O
be O
fine O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
warm O
comfortable O
artsy O
and O
sexy O

The O
food B
is O
great O
big O
selection B
reasonable O
prices B
and O
the O
drinks B
are O
really O
good O

The O
steak B
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O

The O
food B
did O
take O
a O
few O
extra O
minutes O
to O
come O
but O
the O
cute O
waiters' O
jokes O
and O
friendliness O
made O
up O
for O
it O

Most O
importantly O
it O
is O
reasonably O
priced B

The O
selection B
of I
food I
is O
excellent O
I'm O
not O
used O
to O
having O
much O
choice O
at O
restaurants O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
great O

Only O
suggestion O
is O
that O
you O
skip O
the O
dessert B
it O
was O
overpriced O
and O
fell O
short O
on O
taste B

Food B
was O
decent O
but O
not O
great O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
this O
restaurant O
is O
so O
often O
overlooked O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
in O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
the O
perfect O
place O

i O
dont O
know O
what O
some O
people O
who O
rave O
about O
this O
hot B
dog I
are O
talking O
about O

it O
is O
a O
hidden O
delight O
complete O
with O
a O
quaint O
bar B
and O
good O
food B

I O
find O
that O
most O
Kosher O
restaurants O
are O
average O
to O
good O
but O
this O
has O
been O
the O
best O
I've O
eaten O
so O
far O

The O
waiters B
ALWAYS O
look O
angry O
and O
even O
ignore O
their O
high-tipping O
regulars O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
very O
nice O
and O
a O
welcome O
escape O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
SI O
mall O

Yes O
they're O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
then O
typical O
but O
then O
again O
so O
is O
their O
food B

Not O
terrible O
but O
not O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
reviews O
of O
2002 O

I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
wraps B
burgers B
and O
salads B
were O
all O
fresh O
tasty O
and O
the O
mango B
margareta I
at O
$9 O
was O
WELL O
WORTH O
the O
money O

It O
was O
delicious O
and O
large O

Anywhere O
else O
the O
prices B
would O
be O
3x O
as O
high O

The O
service B
we O
experienced O
was O
friendly O
and O
good O

Our O
waiter B
was O
friendly O
and O
it O
is O
a O
shame O
that O
he O
didnt O
have O
a O
supportive O
staff B
to O
work O
with O

The O
folding B
chair I
I O
was O
seated O
at O
was O
uncomfortable O

As O
we O
waited O
I O
watched O
3 O
seperate O
groups O
of O
diners O
discuss O
how O
dissapointed O
they O
also O
were O

An O
excellent O
choice O
in O
midtown O

Service B
was O
among O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
in O
NYC O

The O
fettucino B
alfredo I
was O
amazing O

The O
food B
was O
very O
good O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
see O
so O
many O
vegan B

be O

Montparnasse's O
desserts--especially O
the O
silken O
creme B
brulee I
and O
paper-thin O

good O
enough O
on O
their O

make O
the O

worth O
the O
trip O

My O
friend O
told O
me O
about O
this O
restaurant O

Try O
the O
ribs B
sizzling O
beef B

couple O
it O
with O

The O
only O
drawback O

What O
a O
difference O
the O
service B
was O
very O
comforting O
and O
the O
food B
was O
better O
than O

For O
the O

you'd O
expect O

from O
the O
excellent O

is O
all-around O
good O
with O
the O
rolls B
usually O
excellent O
and O
the O
sushi/sashimi B
not O
quite O
on O
the O
same O
level O

The O
sashimi B
is O
cut O
a O
little O
thinly O

Bay O
Terrace O

nothing O
ok O
almost O
nothing O

Could O

1/3 O
the O

in O
Chinatown O

My O

and O
I O
had O
a O

pork B
product I
know O
to O
us O
Jersey O
girls O

Believe O
me O
they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
name O

Well O
it O
happened O
because O
of O
a O
graceless O
manager B
and O
a O
rude O
bartender B
who O
had O
us O
waiting B
20 O
minutes O
for O
drinks B
and O
then O
tells O
us O
to O
chill O
out O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
service B
great O
but O
forming O
conversation O
around O
a O
table O
is O
so O
easy O
beacuse O
the O
atmosphere B
can O
be O
both O
romantic O
and O
comfortable O

When O
the O
dish B
arrived O
it O
was O
blazing O
with O
green B
chillis I
definitely O
not O
edible O
by O
a O
human O

The O
absolute O
worst O
service B
I've O
ever O
experienced O
and O
the O
food B
was O
below O
average O
when O
they O
actually O
gave O
people O
the O
meals B
they O
ordered O

It's O
about O
$7 O
for O
lunch B
and O
they O
have O
take-out B
or O
dine-in B

They O
are O
by O
far O
the O
BEST O
past O
in O
New O
York O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
before O
attending O
an O
afternoon O
performance O

Everything O
is O
very O
cheap O

Be O
sure O
to O
accompany O
your O
food B
with O
one O
of O
their O
fresh B
juice I
concoctions I

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
reasonable O

The O
place B
is O
clean O
and O
if O
you O
like O
soul B
food I
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B
to O
be O

You'll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
eating O
there O
after O

on O
Ninth O
Avenue O
and O
they O
are O
on O
the O
next O
block O

They O
have O
a O
very O
good O
chicken B
with I
avocado I
and O
good O
tuna B
as O
well O

It's O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
I O
like O
to O
support O

But O
the O
meals B
were O
terrible O

My O
chicken B
was O
completely O
dried O
out O
and O
on O
the O
cold O
side O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
not O
very O
flavorful O

Malted B
Milk I
Ball I
Gelato I
- O
have O
you O
ever O
in O
your O
life O
heard O
of O
anything O
so O
ridiculously O
wonderful O

just O
walk O
by O
the O
window O
and O

all O
the O
unbiased O
positive O
reviews O
in O
all O
the O
major O
nyc O
publications O

Way O
too O
much O
money O
for O
such O
a O
terrible O
meal B

Would O
not O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
go O

However O
the O
service B
is O
absolutely O
horrible O

A O
con O
was O
the O
slow O

service I

Dessert B
was O
also O
to O
die O
for O

BTW O
the O
service B
is O
very O
good O
 
We O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
go O
back O

I O

a O
very O
nice O
experience O

It's O
eaten O
with O
black B
vinegar I
and O
shredded B
ginger I

The O
unattractive O
lighting B
made O
me O
want O
to O
gag O
the O
food B
was O
overpriced O
there O
was O
the O
most O
awful O
disco B
pop I
duo I
performing-and O
my O
escargot B
looked O
like O
it O
might O
crawl O
off O
the O
plate O

We'll O
definitly O
be O
back O
again O

This O
is O
the O
best O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O

it O
is O
a O
cozy O
place B
to O
go O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O

The O
service B

always O
great O
and O
the O
owner B
walks O
around O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
enjoy O

because O
the O
waiters B

Horrible O

If O

Manhattan O
I O
would O
definitely O
go O
more O
often O

the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
highly O
recommended O

When O

time O
to O
take O
the O
order O
the O
waiter B
gave O
us O
a O
hard O
time O
walked O

then O
came O
back O

a O
paper O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
they O
are O
fantastic O

Dieters O

I O

living O
I'm O
very O
fussy O
about O
the O
food B
I O

The O

I O

for O
pizza B
before O

We O

good O

I O

This O

a O
nice O

Brooklyn O
that's O
located O
on O
86 O
street O
right O
underneath O
the O

station O

The O
food B
here O
was O
great O
a O
treat O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O

The O
host B
owner I
and O
servers B
are O
personable O
and O
caring O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
out O
this O
place O
after O
hearing O
about O

in O
many O

IT: O
local O

like O
it O
try O
for O
yourself O
at O
least O
once O

I O
started O
going O
to O
dosa O
hut O
more O
after O
that O

We O
were O
wondering O
why O
they O
were O
there O
to O
make O
our O
dining B
experience I
miserable O

Too O
bad O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Indian B
food I
in O
New O
York O
hands O
down O

The O
waiters B
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
and O
if O
you O
frequent O
they O
will O
remember O
you O

Intimate O
but O
charming O
interior B
with O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
service B

The O
food B
was O
as O
creative O
as O
the O
decor B
and O
both O
worked O

Siam O
Square O
is O
fairly O
new O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
I O
think O
in O
time O
will O
gain O
the O
recognition O
it O
deserves O

My O
first O
experience O
at O
Siam O
Square O
was O
very O
pleasant O

I O
have O
gone O
back O
to O
Siam O
Square O
many O
times O
since O
and O
everytime O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
overall O

The O
menu B
is O
great O
with O
a O
good O
selection B
and O
everything O
that O
I O
have O
tried O
is O
absolutely O
delicious O

We O
had O
our O
Christmas O
party O
at O
Dos O
Caminos O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful O

My O
personal O
favorite O
is O
Nick O
and O
Joe's O

The O
sauce B
is O
zesty O
and O
flavorful O
and O
the O
crust B
is O
nice O
and O
crispy O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
sushi B
in O
the O
city O

They O
have O
an O
excellent O
selection B
the O
rolls B
with I
crab I
are O
really O
great O

Everyone O
who O
works O
there O
the O
host B
the O
bartender B
the O
servers B
is O
so O
helpful O

And O
the O
food B
is O
fantastic O

Favourites O
include: O
potato B
spinach I
gnocchi I
and O
the O
lamb B

Another O
great O
thing O
about O
Glechik-everything O
is O
very O
cheap O

Unfortunately O
we O
chose O
this O
spot O
for O
lunch B
as O
we O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
and O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
South O
St O
Seaport O

But O
regulars O
know O
that O
the O
sandwiches B
are O
the O
real O
star O
here O

The O
skillfully O
chosen O
Portuguese B
cheese I
cart I
paired O
with O
quality O
port B
provides O
the O
perfect O
Iberian O
ending O

My O
friend O
had O
a O
burger B
and O
I O
had O
these O
wonderful O
blueberry B
pancakes I

We O
were O
so O
happy O
with O
our O
food B
and O
were O
even O
more O
thrilled O
when O
we O
saw O
the O
bill B

I O
would O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O

The O
place O
just O
isn't O
ready O
for O
prime O
time O

All O
toppings B
are O
so O
fresh O
you'd O
think O
they O
had O
their O
own O
vegetable O
garden O
and O
the O
crust B
is O
so O
perfect O
that O
one O
actually O
thinks O
of O
how O
it O
was O
made O

Quartino O
is O
my O
favoriate O
resturant O
in O
NYC O

We've O
always O
gotten O
amazing O
service B
and O
we O
love O
the O
food B

The O
waitstaff B
is O
solicitous O
and O
friendly O
and O
always O
seems O
glad O
to O
see O
us O
and O
the O
food B
is O
wonderful O
if O
not O
stunningly O
creative O

I'm O
in O
love O
with O
the O
lobster B
ravioli I

My O
order O
is O
on O
my O
table O
even O
on O
a O
busy O
friday O
night O
within O
10 O
minutes O
at O
the O
most O
of O
hanging O
up O
the O
phone O

We O
came O
across O
this O
restaurant O
by O
accident O
while O
at O
a O
DUMBO O
art O
festival O
and O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
our O
meal B

Service B
is O
excellent O
no O
wait B
and O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
price B

I O
thought O
the O
food B
isn't O
cheap O
at O
all O
compared O
to O
Chinatown O

And O
you O
never O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
need O
to O
leave O

Coffee B
is O
a O
better O
deal O
than O
overpriced O
Cosi B
sandwiches I

We O
didn't O
know O
if O
we O
should O
order O
a O
drink B
or O
leave O

great O
neighbhorhood O
spot O

Bobb O
V's O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
your O
Friends O
and O
Family O

 It's O
not O
the O
best O
Japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
but O
it's O
a O
pretty O
solid O
one O
for O
its O
modest O
prices B
and O
worth O
repeat O
visits O

The O
food B
is O
so O
good O
and O
so O
popular O
that O
waiting B
can O
really O
be O
a O
nightmare O

Here's O
the O
thing O
you're O
in O
the O
best O
city O
in O
the O
world O
for O
restaurants O

Go O
spend O
your O
money O
somewhere O
that O
really O
wows O
you O

The O
crowd O
was O
older O
and O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
cramped O
but O
it O
has O
old O
school O
charm O

This O
is O
a O
real O
gem O
of O
a O
place O

I O
think O
this O
a O
a O
wonderful O
place O

First O
walking O
in O
the O
place B
seemed O
to O
have O
great O
ambience B

I O
went O
to O
Kitchenette O
this O
weekend O
for O
brunch B

This O
place O
doesn't O
get O
the O
publicity O
that O
Sylvias O
Soul O
Food O
restaurant O
does O
but O
it O
should O

Just O
because O
P O
Diddy O
had O
a O
party O
at O
Butter O
doesn't O
mean O
we O
should O
be O
automatically O
impressed O

Even O
for O
two O
very O
hungry O
people O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
food B
left O
to O
be O
taken O
home O
it O
reheats O
really O
well O
also O

Like O
I O
said O
Nick O
and O
Joe's O
may O
not O
be O
everyone's O
favorite O
but O
it's O
mine O

The O
help O
was O
extremely O
nice O
and O
did O
not O
rush O
us O

Then O
they O
somehow O
made O
a O
dry O
and O
burnt O
crust B
around O
a O
raw O
and O
cold O
inside O

It's O
just O
good O
food B
nothing O
more O
and O
that's O
all O
we O
want O

DON'T O
KNOW O
WHAT O
THE O
OTHERS O
ON O
THE O
BLOCK O
WERE O
LIKE O
BUT O
WE O
WERE O
PLEASED O
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O

Average O
cake B
thats O
been O
courted O
by O
a O
LOT O
of O
hype O

It's O
cute O
and O
simple O
and O
I O
loved O
it O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
recently O
visited O
the O
bistro O
for O
dinner B
and O

a O
wonderful O
experience O

THE O
SERVICE B
IS O

 NOTHING O
WRONG O
IN O
THIS O
ITALIAN/FRENCH O
RESTAURANT O

The O
$72 O
Delmonico B
steak I
had O
to O
be O
sent O
back O
because O
it O
was O
not O
cooked O
to O
order O

Everytime O
I O
go O
there O
I O
can't O
pick O
anything O
to O
eat O
and O
not O
because O
the O
menu B
is O
filled O
with O
great O
things O
to O
eat O

Half O
a O
chicken B

a O
mountain O
of O
rice B
and O

for O
$625 O

The O
service B
is O
really O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
value B
is O
great O

We O
were O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
and O
value B

You O
must O
try O
the O
garlic B

Casablanca O

delicious O
falafel B
tabouleh B
humus B
and O
other O
Mediterranean B

which O
are O
all O
very O
inexpensive O

Even O
after O
a O
few O
bad O
evenings O
at O
Bardolino O
I O
keep O
coming O
back O

The O
pizza's B
are O
made O
fresh O
crispy O
and O
ready O
to O
serve O

There O
are O
many O
french O
bistros O
in O
the O
midtown O
area O
and O
I O
wholheartedly O
recommend O
this O

up O

This O

Being O
a O
vegan O
myself O
I've O
made O
a O
point O
of O
trying O
all O
the O

in O
Manhattan--and O
Zen O

my O

one O
of O
my O

good O

the O

very O
good O

Cantinetta O
is O
a O
real O
treasure O
in O
a O
see O
of O
mediocre O
Italian O
restaurants O

The O
one O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
service B
was O
prompt O
we O
got O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
the O
server B
was O
very O
friendly O

The O
staff B
greeted O
me O
warmly O
at O
the O
door O
and O
I O
was O
seated O
promptly O
and O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O

Whether O
one O
pizza O
place O
is O
better O
than O
another O
is O
often O
very O
subjective O

Really O
nice O
restaurant O
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
or O
on O

meal B

I O
recommend O
any O
of O
their O
salmon B
dishes I

The O
foie B
gras I
was O
sweet O
and O
luscious O

The O
menu B
which O
changes O
seasonally O
shows O
both O
regional O
and O
international O
influences O

but O
their O
mac B
cheese I
was O
YUMMY O

their O
brunch B
menu I
had O
something O
for O
everyone O

jazz B

I O
often O
find O
myself O
with O
time O
to O
kill O
in O
Times O
Square O
which O
is O
a O
shame O
since O
I O
don't O
love O
this O
area O

They O
have O
very O
quick O
service B
which O
is O
great O
when O
you O
don't O
have O
much O
time O

The O
food B
is O
average: O
breakfast B
food B
soups B
salads B
sandwiches B
etc O

I O
WAS O
HIGHLY O
DISAPPOINTED O
BY O
THE O
FOOD B

THE O
BANANA B
PUDDING I
THEY O
SERVE O
HAS O
NEVER O
SEEN O
AN O
OVENTHE O
CRABCAKES B
ARE O
WAY O
OVER O
SALTED O
AND O
DON'T O
GET O
ME O
STARTED O
ON O
THE O
VERY O
GREASY O
MAC B
AND I
CHEESE I

The O
staff B
is O
arrogant O
the O
prices B
are O
way O
high O
for O
Brooklyn O

This O
place O
is O
average O
at O
best O

the O
service B
is O
prompt O
friendly O

Whatever O
the O
reason O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
place O
to O
be O

This O
is O
literally O
a O
hot O
spot O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
food B

The O
downstairs B
bar I
scene I
is O
very O
cool O
and O
chill O

The O
food B
was O
definitely O
good O
but O
when O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
I O
just O
couldn't O
justify O
it O
for O
the O
price B
including O
2 O
drinks B
$100/person O

I've O
come O
here O
for O
casual B
lunches I
as O
well O
as O
for O
a O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
myself O

If O
you O
are O
a O
Tequila B
fan O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O

Great O
beer B
selection I
too O
something O
like O
50 O
beers B

After O
reading O
the O
great O
reviews O
I O
invited O
a O
die-hard O
downtown O
friend O
of O
mine O
to O
join O
me O
at O
TASTE O

Not O
to O
sound O
too O
negative O
but O
be O
wary O
of O
the O
delivary B

Feels O
like O
family O
when O
we O
go O
there O

I O
found O
the O
food B
to O
be O
just O
as O
good O
as O
its O
owner B
Da O
Silvano O
just O
much O
less O
expensive O

They O
have O
homemade B
pastas I
of O
all O
kinds O
-- O
I O
recommend O
the O
gnocchi B
-- O
yum O

My O
vegetable B
risotto I
was O
burnt O
and O
infused O
totally O
in O
a O
burnt O
flavor B

What O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O

The O
main O
draw O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
price B

How O
can O
hope O
to O
stay O
in O
business O
with O
service B
like O
this O

But O
dinner B
here O
is O
never O
disappointing O
even O
if O
the O
prices B
are O
a O
bit O
over O
the O
top O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
have O
amazing O
sandwiches B
soup B
pizza B
etc O
but O
their O
homemade B
sorbets I
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O

the O
homemade B
Guacamole I
the O
unbelievable O
entree B
and O
thee O
most O
amazing O
deserts B

The O
sushi B
is O
reasonably O
priced B
and O
fresh O

It's O
no-fuss O
fast O
and O
delicious O

Save O
room O
for O
deserts B
- O
they're O
to O
die O
for O

Best O
things O
to O
order O
are O
from O
the O
grill B
Churrasco B
and O
Ribs B

The O
traditional B
Italian I
items I
are O
great O
- O
cheap O
and O
served B
in O
a O
cozy O
setting B

Whether O
your O
choose O
the O
iced B
blended I
mocha I
or O
the O
hot B
white I
mocha I
you O
are O
sure O
to O
be O
extremely O
happy O

last O
Tuesday O
for O
a O
late B
lunch I
with O
a O
friend O

It O
was O
delish O
and O
I O
didn't O
feel O
bad O
eating O
it O

Another O
friend O
had O
to O
ask O
3 O
times O
for O
parmesan B
cheese I

Our O
waitress B
had O
apparently O
never O
tried O
any O
of O
the O
food B
and O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
recommend O
any O
wine B

The O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
and O
the O
portions B
are O
a O
bit O
small O
so O
if O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
in O
a O
rush O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O

No O
doubt O
the O
next O
time O
we O
want O
to O
go O
out O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
or O
are O
entertaining O
guests O
from O
out O
of O
town O
Spirit O
and O
Bateaux O
will O
be O
our O
destination O

i O
would O
recommend O
Jewel O
Bako O
if O
you O
want O
to O
feel O
like O
you O
were O
kicked O
in O
the O
groin O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
too O

The O
ambiance B
was O
pretty O
cool O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
hassle O

The O
unfortunate O
lady O
next O
to O
us O
thought O
she O
had O
ordered O
a O
salad B
including O
asking O
for O
salad B
dressing O
and O
was O
instead O
given O
a O
quesedilla B

El O
Nidos O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
which O
I've O
ever O
been O
to O
has O
a O
great O
variety O
of O
tasty O
mouth O
watering O
pizza's B

The O
service B
was O
pretty O
poor O
all O
around O
the O
food B
was O
well O
below O
average O
relative O
to O
the O
cost B
and O
outside O
there O
is O
a O
crazy O
bum O
who O
harasses O
every O
customer O
who O
leaves O
the O
place O

Although O
I O
moved O
uptown O
I O
try O
to O
stop O
in O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
for O
the O
GREAT O
cheap O
food B
and O
to O
pay O
the O
friendly O
staff B
a O
visit O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
friend O
at O
the O
bar B
for O
a O
few O
minutes O

Chef B
Vincenzo O
always O
there O
if O
you O
need O
him O
is O
a O
real O
talent O
and O
a O
real O
Roman O

If O
you're O
looking O
to O
taste O
some O
great O
Indian B
food I
and O
want O
good O
service B
definitely O
visit O
Curry O
Leaf O

You O
must O
try O
Odessa B
stew I
or O
Rabbit B
stew; I
salads-all O
good; O
and O
kompot B
is O
soo O
refreshing O
during O
the O
hot O
summer O
day O
they O
make O
it O
the O
way O
my O
mom O
does O
reminds O
me O
of O
home O
a O
lot O

My O
daughter O
and O
I O
left O
feeling O
satisfied O
not O
stuffed O
and O
it O
felt O
good O
to O
know O
we O
had O
a O
healthy O
lunch B

I'm O
almost O
tempted O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
bad O
review O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
the O
crowds O
awaybeen O
going O
there O
on O
and O
off O
for O
a O
year O
now O
and O
it's O
really O
my O
fave O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
city O

When O
she O
complained O
the O
waitress B
said O
Sorry O

The O
quality B
of I
the I
meat I
was O
on O
par O
with O
your O
local O
grocery O
store O

They O
specialize O
in O
smoothies B
and O
fresh B
juices I

It O
first O
came O
well O
done O
and O
I O
politely O
sent O
it O
back O

I O
recommend O
the O
black B
roasted I
codfish I
it O
was O
the O
best O
dish B
of O
the O
evening O

The O
manager B
then O
told O
us O
we O
could O
order O
from O
whatever O
menu B
we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O
we O
were O
so O
annoyed O
with O
the O
waiter B
and O
the O
resturant O
that O
we O
let O
and O
went O
some O
place O
else O

In O
mi O
burrito O
here O
was O
nothing O
but O
dark O
chicken B
that O
had O
that O
cooked O
last O
week O
and O
just O
warmed O
up O
in O
a O
microwave O
taste B

during O
busy O
hrs O
i O
recommend O
that O
you O
make O
a O
reservation B

Don't O
waste O
your O
time O
or O
your O
money O

it's O
good O
but O
like O
the O
movie O
is O
never O
as O
good O
as O
the O
book O
this O
is O
same O
analogy O

it O
was O
a O
very O
warm O
experience O

I O
went O
to O
Common O
Stock O
for O
brunch B
and O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O

now O
called O
nikki O
sushi B
sushi B
is O
OK O

The O
food B
is O
also O
outstanding O
and O
is O
served B
quite O
quickly O

I O
just O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place O
that O
is O
negative O
except O
that O
it's O
not O
a O
cheap O
night O
outbut O
it's O
SO O
worth O
it O

From O
the O
erbazzone B
emiliana I
to O
the O
mostarda B
on I
the I
cheese I
plate I
the O
dishes B
at O
this O
restaurant O
are O
all O
handled O
with O
delicate O
care O

The O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
bar B
has O
a O
great O
vibe B

expectations O
were O
real O
hi O
reading O
the O
'10's' O

There's O
candlelight B
and O
music B

It's O
nice O
to O
find O
a O
place O
that O
is O
open O
24 O
hours O
especially O
in O
downtown O
Brooklyn O

Simple O
healthy O
unglamorous O
food B
cheap O

It O
was O
such O
a O
fantastic O
dining B
experience I
that O
I O
returned O
again O
the O
same O
week O

To O
be O
fair O
the O
food B
still O
is O
good O
and O
the O
service B
is O
quick O
and O
attentative O
even O
though O
its O
usually O
very O
busy O

The O
place B
is O
absolutely O
adorable O
and O
the O
food B
is O
delicious O

I O
ordered O
the O
Chicken B
Teriyaki I
and O
my O
husband O
got O
Garlic B
Shrimp I

I've O
had O
better O
Japanese B
food I
at O
a O
mall O
food O
court O

The O
staff B
members I
are O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
even O
replaced O
my O
drink B
once O
when O
I O
dropped O
it O
outside O

Cool O
atmosphere B
but O
such O
a O
let O
down O

The O
Sashimi B
portion I
are O
big O
enough O
to O
appease O
most O
people O
but O
I O
didn't O
like O
the O
fact O
they O
used O
artifical B
lobster I
meat I

They O
have O
wheat B
crusted I
pizza I
made O
with O
really O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
ingredients B

Had O
a O
lovely O
dinner B
in O
this O
dedicated O
seafood O
joint O
food B
was O
well-prepared O
and O
-presented O
and O
the O
service B
was O
pleasant O
and O
prompt O

the O
icing O
MADE O
this O
cake B
it O
was O
fluffy O
not O
ultra O
sweet O
creamy O
and O
light O

Finally O
let O
into O
the O
store O
5 O
at O
a O
time O
to O
buy O
expensive O
slices B
from O
a O
harried O
staff B

We O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
just O
leave O
because O
we O
were O
essentially O
being O
ignored O
by O
the O
wait B
staff--even I
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
largely O
empty O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
well O
priced B
and O
covers O
alot O
of O
regions O

Go O
here O
if O
you O
want O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
salads B
of O
any O
type O
you O
can O
imagine O

Everything O
about O
this O
place O
is O
adorable O
- O
even O
the O
bathroom B

Speedy O
delivers B
great O
food B
decent O
prices B
and O
friendly O
service B
combine O
to O
ensure O
an O
enjoyable O
repast B

THEY O
HAVE O
WAITERS B
ON O
THE O
SIDEWALK O
TRYING O
TO O
PULL O
YOU O
IN O
WHICH O
MADE O
US O
SUSPICIOUS O

IT O
WAS O
OUR O
ONLY O
OPPORTUNITY O
TO O
VISIT O
AND O
WANTED O
AN O
AUTHENTIC O
ITALIAN B
MEAL I

It O
took O
100 O
years O
for O
Parisi O
to O
get O
around O
to O
making O
pizza B
at O
least O
I O
don't O
think O
they O
ever O
made O
it O
before O
this O
yearbut O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
simple O
medium O
rare O
steak B

Generously O
garnished O
organic B
grilled I
burgers I
are O
the O
most O
popular O
dish B
but O
the O
Jerusalem B
market-style I
falafel I
wraps I
and O
Mediterranean B
salads--layered I
with I
beets I
goat I
cheese I
and I
walnuts--are I
equally O
scrumptious O

Probably O
my O
worst O
dining B
experience I
in O
new O
york O
and O
I'm O
a O
former O
waiter B
so O
I O
know O
what O
I'm O
talking O
about O

Result O
red O
velvet: O
Great O
texture B
soft O
and O
velvety O
nice O

of I
cocoa I

Ask O
for O
the O
round B
corner I
table I
next I
to I
the I
large I
window I

Their O

is O
heatlhy O
but O
full O
of O
flavor B

The O
lack O
of O
AC B
and O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
a O
million O
swarming O
bodies O
although O
everyone O
is O
polite O
and O
no O
one O
is O
pushing O
is O
a O
slight O
turn O
off O

I O
love O
the O
Little O
Pie O
Company O
as O
much O
as O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
written O
reviews O
but O
must O
discourage O
anyone O
from O
visiting O
the O
Grand O
Central O
location O
due O
to O
their O
RUDE O
service B
from O
two O
sales B
people I

Unfortunately O
unless O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
it's O
not O
in O
a O
convenient O
location B
but O
is O
more O
like O
a O
hidden O
treasure O

Didn't O
seem O
like O
any O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
the O
display B
and I
quality I
of I
the I
food I

The O
food--though O
mostly O
deep-fried--is O
simple O
and O
satisfying O

We O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
have O
been O
going O
there O
twice O
a O
week O
since O
the O
day O
they O
first O
opened O

Glechik O
might O
be O
way O
too O
tiny O
for O
a O
restaurant O
by O
Russian O
standards O
but O
it O
is O
cozy O
and O
the O
food B
is O
simply O
GREAT O

The O
food B
was O
excellent O
- O
authentic O
Italian B
cuisine I
made O
absolutely O
fresh O

At O
night O
the O
atmoshere B
changes O
turning O
into O
this O
hidden O
jewel O
that O
is O
waiting O
to O
be O
discovered O

The O
other O
times O
I've O
gone O
it's O
romantic O
date O
heaven O
you O
can O
walk O
in O
get O
a O
booth B
by I
the I
windows I
be O
treated O
like O
a O
VIP O
in O
a O
not-crowded O
place B
with O
great O
food B
and O
service B

I O
would O
only O
go O
for O
the O
coffee B
which O
is O
way O
better O
than O
Starbucks O
or O
the O
like O

I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
costumer O
at O
pongal O
until O
dosa O
hut O
opened O
right O
next O
door O
to O
it O

Somewhat O
disappointing O
wine B
list I
only O
new O
vintages B

Both O
were O
very O
good O
but O
nothing O
you O
couldn't O
get O
at O
similar O
restaurant O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
nasty O
high O
priced B
food B
with O
a O
dash O
of O
ghetto O
scenery B
cheap O
BX O
A$$ O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
be O

new B
hamburger I
with I
special I
sauce I
is O
ok O
- O
at O
least O
better O
than O
big B
mac I

Perfectly O
al O
dente O
pasta B
not O
drowned O
in O
sauce B
-- O
generous O
portions B

I O
can O
understand O
the O
prices B
if O
it O
served O
better O
food B
like O
some O
Chinese O
restaurants O
in O
midtown/uptown O
area O

Service B
was O
awful O
- O
mostly O
because O
staff B
were O
overwhelmed O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O

To O
the O
owners; O
good O
job O
guys O
this O
place O
is O
a O
keeper O

and O
the O
owner B
is O
simply O
lovely O
and O
friendly O

This O
little O
place B
is O
wonderfully O
warm O
welcoming O

perfect O
for O
a O
quick O
meal B

Has O
the O
warmth O
of O
a O
family O
local O
yet O
it O
is O
a O
great O
place B
to O
watch O
sporting O
events O

The O
service B
was O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
whole O
great O
deal O
for O
birthdays O

The O
staff B
is O
100% O
Italian O
and O
the O
food B
is O
as O
authentic O
as O
it O
gets O

My O
only O
complaint O
might O
be O
the O
fortune B
cookies I
- O
I've O
never O
had O
a O
cookie B
predict O
bad O
luck O
for O
me O
before O
I O
visited O
Kar O

Good O
for O
a O
quick O
sushi B
lunch I

Have O
a O
mojito B
and O
sit O
in O
the O
back B
patio I

The O
service B
was O
dreadfully O
slow O
the O
place O
was O
only O
half O
full O
and O
a O
smile O
would O
have O
been O
nice O

I O
went O
this O
past O
Saturday O
and O
had O
a O
excellent O
meal B
of O
consisting O
of O
a O
braised B
lamb I
shank I
with I
mashed I
potatoes I

The O
waitress B
came O
by O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
soy B
sauce I
WHILE O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
lunch B

So O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B
the O
bartender B
didn't O
seem O
like O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
there O

I O
reccomend O
the O
fried B
pork I
dumplings I
the O
orange B
chicken/beef I
and O
the O
fried B
rice I

You O
will O
not O
be O
dissapointed O
by O
any O
of O
the O
choices O
in O
the O
menu B

The O
french B
fries I
-- I
with I
the I
kalmata I
dip I
were O
terrific O

Would O
you O
ever O
believe O
that O
when O
you O
complain O
about O
over O
an O
hour O
wait B
when O
they O
tell O
you O
it O
will O
be O
20-30 O
minutes O
the O
manager B
tells O
the O
bartender B
to O
spill O
the O
drinks B
you O
just O
paid O
for O

The O
boutique B
selection I
of I
wines I
covers O
a O
wide O
variety O
without O
being O
imposeing O

If O
you're O
lucky O
and O
there's O
not O
a O
private O
party O
going O
on O
back O
there O
you'll O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
chill O
out O

They O
also O
have O
a O
great O
assortment B
of I
wraps I
if O
your O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
traditional B
Mediterranean I
fare I

Fresh B
veggies I
all O
sorts O
of O
middle B
eastern I
spreads I
cheese B
and O
falafel B
soup B
fish B
rice B
root B
vegetables I
a O

medley O
some O

thing I
lamb B
kebabs I
cheese B
baclava O
soooo O
much O
fooood B
and O
all O
of O
it O
delicious O

Disappointingly O
their O
wonderful O
Saketini B
has O
been O
taken O
off O
the O
bar B
menu I

In O
Short O
The O
Black O
Sheep O
distinguishes O
itself O
from O
the O
Midtown O
pub O
herd O
with O
a O
look B
that's O
a O
mix O
of O
sports-bar O
butch O
and O
ornate O
kitsch O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
-- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B
on O
the O
blackboard O

They O
are O
located O
off O
the O
beaten O
path O
but O
are O
certainly O
worth O
the O
trip O

then O
she O
made O
a O
fuss O
about O
not O
being O
able O
to O
add O
1 O
or O
2 O
chairs B
on O
either O
end O
of O
the O
table B
for O
additional O
people O

The O
happy B
hour I
is O
so O
cheap O
but O
that O
does O
not O
reflect O
the O
service B
or O
the O
atmosphere B

After O
waiting B
for O
almost O
an O
hour O
the O
waiter B
brusquely O
told O
us O
he'd O
forgotten O
to O
give O
the O
kitchen B
our O
order O

With O
all O
the O
mundane O
or O
mediocre O
places O
on O
8th O
avenue O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
one O
that O
is O
a O
step O
above O
in O
quaility B
and O
atmosphere B

A O
mix O
of O
students O
and O
area O
residents O
crowd O
into O
this O
narrow O
barely O
there O
space B
for O
its O
quick O
tasty O
treats B
at O
dirt-cheap O
prices B

Give O
it O
a O
try O
menu B
is O
typical O
French O
but O
varied O

It O
gets O
crowded O
at O
lunchtime O
but O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
seats B
in O
back O
and O
everyone O
who O
works O
there O
is O
so O
nice O

but O
for O
the O
value B
it O
was O
a O
great O
affordable O
spot O
to O
enjoy O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
with O
small O
group O

the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
city O
search O
are O
probably O
from O
jealous O
competing O
restaurants O
who O
realize O
they O
can't O
compete O
with O
Temple's O
entire O
positive O
attitude B
about O
the O
proper O
way O
to O
treat O
their O
customers O
and O
deliver O
top O
quality O
food B

We O
ordered O
a O
glass B
of I
wine I
and O
were O
finished O
eating O
and O
paying O
before O
the O
wine O
came O

It O
was O
good O
but O
none O
of O
the O
flavors B
WOW O

Overall O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
place B
to O
take O
a O
few O
friends O
to O
hang O
out O
at O
and O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O

Food B
is O
excellent O
quality O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
price B

Actually O
everyone O
who O
worked O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
annoyed O

for O
about O
eleven O
bucks O
you O
get O
a O
gigantic O
burrito B
or O
tacos B
margarita B
and O
dessert B

The O
space B
is O
traditional O
in O
feel O

the O
restaurant O
was O
completely O
empty O
but O
she O
gave O
me O
a O
dirty O
look O
and O
asked O
no O
reservations B

the O
food B
was O
mediocre O
to O
be O
kind O
- O
the O
interior B
is O
small O
and O
average O
- O
the O
owners B
are O
a O
tag-team O
of O
unpleasantries O
- O
so O
rude O
and O
snotty O
i O
actually O
let O
out O
a O
hearty O
guffaw O
whilst O
dining B

Good O
service B
great O
food B
good O
value B
and O
never O
have O
to O
wait B
in O
line O

Offerings O
like O
hot B
cakes I
and O
the O
Egg B
McMuffin I
sandwich I
are O
available O
for O
breakfast B

I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years O
in O
the O
past O
the O
service B
was O
average O
and O
the O
food B
inconsistant O

The O
music B
was O
fascinating O
but O
left O
room O
for O
conversation O
and O
the O
bartender B
made O
superb O
drinks B

rice B
dishes I
and O
noodle B
dishes I
rarely O
exceed O
$5 O
and O
add O
on O
a O
refreshing O
ice B
drink I
for O
$2 O
and O
you're O
set O
for O
the O
night O

Cuisine B
is O
billed B
as O
asian B
fusion I
- O
doesn't O
meet O
the O
bill B

Creative O
dishes B
like O
king B
crab I
salad I
with I
passion I
fruit I
vinaigrette I
and O
fettuccine B
with I
grilled I
seafood I
in I
a I
rosemary-orange I
sauce I
are O
unexpected O
elements O
on O
an O
otherwise O
predictable O
bistro B
menu I

Dishes B
denoted O
as O
"Roy's B
Classics" I
marked O

The O
cold B
sesame I
noodles I
which O
are O
a O
freebie O
when O
you O
order O
$10+ O
are O
delectable O

I O
came O
to O
fresh O
expecting O
a O
great O
meal B
and O
all O
I O
got O
was O
marginally O
so-so O
food B
served B
in O
a O
restaurant O
that O
was O
just O
so O
freezing O
we O
couldn't O
enjoy O
eating O

The O
lone O
argentine B
chorizo I
appetizer I
at O
$895 O
was O
a O
heavy O
fennel B
flavored I
Italian I
sausage I
like O
the O
ones O
that O
sell O
for O
$299/lb O
at O
the O
store O

I O
went O
to O
Swiftys O
with O
some O
friends O
of O
the O
family O
and O
we O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
dinner B
but O
nothing O
amazing O

Best O
Chinese O
on O

Most O
of O
the O
sandwiches B
are O
made O
with O
soy B
mayonaise I
which O
is O
actually O
pretty O
good O

i O
went O
in O
one O
day O
asking O
for O
a O
table B
for O
a O
group O
and O
was O
greeted O
by O
a O
very O
rude O
hostess B

It's O
worthwhile O
to O
take O
a O
cab O
to O
Chelsea O
just O
for O
an O
awesome O
dinner B
at O
My O
Chelsea O

Not O

the O

authentic O
but O
the O

here O
are O
practically O
off-the-boat O

are O
young O

hip O
and O

what O
they O
are O
doing O

was O
amazing O

the O
dinner B
menu I
offers O
a O
variety O
of O
great O
entrees B
including O
fresh O
seafood B
and O
huge O
steaks B
there's O
also O
a O
couple O
of O
non-meat B
alternatives I

This O
place O
has O
the O
strangest O
menu B
and O
the O
restaurants O
tries O
too O
hard O
to O
make O
fancy O
food B

The O
appetizers B
are O
ok O
but O
the O
service B
is O
slow O

the O
food B
- O
not O
worth O
the O
price B

What O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
place O
where O
the O
waitress B
brings O
out O
the O
wrong O
entree B
then O
verbally O
assaults O
your O
80 O
year O
old O
grandmother O
and O
gives O
her O
lip O
about O
sending O
it O
back O
which O
she O
did O
politely O
by O
the O
way O

The O
prices B
are O
not O
terrible O

15% O
gratuity B
automatically O
added O
to O
the O
bill B

The O
halibut B
cheek I
appetizer I
came O
with O
a O
generous O
portion B
of I
foie I
gras I
but O
that's O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
meal B

Food B
is O
excellent O
and O
they O
also O
have O
empenadas B
and O
plaintains B
which O
are O
good O
for O
an O
afternoon B
snack I

Both O
a O
number O
of O
the O
appetizer B
and O
pasta B
specials I
were O
amazing O

All-time O
favorites O
include O
the O
Big B
Mac I
Chicken B
McNuggets I
Filet-O-Fish B
sandwich I
and O
McDonald's B
famous I
french I
fries; I
lighter O
options O
like O
entree-sized B
salads I
are O
also O
available O

Although O
somewhat O
loud O
the O
noise B
was O
minimally O
intrusive O

It's O
a O
basic O
pizza B
joint O
not O
much O
to O
look O
at O
but O
the O
pizza B
is O
what O
I O
go O
for O

Tables B
are O
close O
so O
you O
better O
be O
comfortable O
bumping O
elbows O
with O
other O
patrons O

Was O
her O
Monday O
for O
lunch B
- O
was O
working O
on O
a O
film O
in O
the O
area O
- O
and O
found O
this O
rare O
jewel O

Not O
too O
much O
so O
but O
enough O
that O
there's O
a O
great O
scene B

You O
feel O
like O
you O
made O
it O
to O
New O
York O
when O
you O
eat O
here O

We'd O
walked O
by O
it O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
finally O
settled O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O

SUM O
IT: O
don't O
read O
the O
'10's' O
reviews O
try O
it O
to O
judge O
for O
yourself O
so O
you O
won't O
have O
as O
hi O
expectations O
then O
you'll O
be O
sure O
to O
enjoy O
it O

We O
went O
there O
no O
one O
greeted O
us O

Dug O
the O
blue B
bar I
area I
too O

We O
spent O
so O
much O
time O
getting O
elbowed O
around O
while O
we O
waited O
we O
left O

I O
got O
the O
opportunity O
to O
dine O
at O
your O
establishment O
again O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
I O
was O
in O
your O
upstrairs B
dining I
area I

Meat-phobes O
are O
in O
luck O
with O
the O
extraordinary O
veggie B
burger I
made O
from O
a O
distinctive O
blend O
of O
chickpeas B
carrots B
and O
other O
vegetables B
and O
spices B

At O
peak O
times O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overcrowded O
and O
tables B
are O
uncomfortably O
close O

The O
service B
was O
on O
point O
- O
what O
else O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
Ritz O

Menus B
feature O
seasonal O
picks O
like O
sweet B
corn-foie I
gras I
brulee I

Innovations O
are O
just O
as O
assured O
from O
the O
simple O
Carinthia B
cheese I
ravioli I
with I
wild I
mushrooms I
to O
the O
caviar-topped B
sturgeon I
beautifully O
matched O
with O
a O
bright O
green B
spinach-vodka I
sauce I

And O
these O
are O
not O
small O
wimpy O
fast O
food O
type O
burgers B
- O
these O
are O
real O
full O
sized O
patties B

There O
restaurant O
is O
very O
casual O
but O
perfect O
for O
lunch B
and O
their O
delivery B
service I
is O
always O
very O
fast O

Chinatown O
definitely O
has O
better O
quality B
with O
cheaper O
prices B

I O
had O
to O
flag O
down O
a O
third O
staff B
person I
for O
a O
fork B
so O
now O
it's O
goodbye O

have O
been O
in O
NYC O
for O
over O
10 O
years O
and O
could O
not O
find O
this O
delicacy O
east O
of O
the O
Hudson O
 
Go O
with O
the O
specials B
and O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
salmon B
 
The O
pastas B
were O
pretty O
good O

Atmosphere B
is O
a O
bore O

The O
decor B
is O
what O
initially O
got O
me O
in O
the O
door O

The O
wait B
staff I
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite O

Great O
restaurant O
and O
even O
greater O
food B

The O
dishes B
are O
remarkably O
tasty O
and O
such O
a O
cozy O
and O
intimate O
place B

Save O

I O
love O
the O
simplicity O
and O
respect O
which O
was O
given O
to O
the O
food B
as O
well O
the O
staff B
was O
freindly O
and O
knowledgable O

Service B
was O
good O
and O
so O
was O
the O
atmosphere B

MY O
date O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Branzini B
and O
both O
felt O
the O
fish B
was O
very O
average O

We O
were O
there O
March O

and O
found O
Maison O
very O
nice O

The O
food B
was O
good O
the O
service B
prompt O
and O
the O

very O
reasonable O
 
Wonderful O

the O
FOOD B

Great O

wine B
and O
an O
excellent O
host B

went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
my O
coworker O

Pizzas B
were O
excellent O
in O
addition O
to O
appetizers B
and O
main B
courses I

Definitely O
try O
the O
calamari B
any O
pasta B
or O
even O
the O
Sliced B
steak I
entree I

The O
caeser B
salad I
was O
great O

The O
fried B
calamari I
was O
even O
better O

The O
atmosphere B
was O
nice O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
dark O

The O
food B
was O
good O
overall O
 
The O
food B
was O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B
was O
tops O

The O
portions B
are O
very O
large O
and O
the O
service B
is O
fantastic O

I O
recomend O
the O
chicken B
milanese I

excellent O
tapas B
at O
great O
prices B
romantic O
small O
but O
not O
overly O
crowed O
excellent O

The O
service B
is O
a O
quite O
slow O
but O
friendly O

The O
chocolate B
raspberry I
cake I
is O
heavenly- O
not O
too O
sweet O
but O
full O
of O
flavor B

Our O
waiter B
was O
helpful O
and O
charming O
the O
food B
was O
perfect O
and O
the O
wine B
was O
good O
too O

Alias O
is O
warm O
and O
cozy O
and O
you O
don't O
get O
that O

@ O

Best O
hot B

in O
the O
tri-state O
area O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
example O
of O
an O
establishment O
in O
which O
its O
owners O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
restaurant O
business O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
MEET O
at O
all O
it O
is O
a O
rip O
off O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
time O
to O
step O
in O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
special O
celebration O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quiet O
and O
intimate O

The O
service B
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
very O
generous O

We O
had O
tons O
of O
great O
food B
wine B
and O
desserts B

Really O
Lovely O
dining B
experience I
in O
the O
midst O
of O
buzzing O
midtown O
area O

OK O
I've O
been O
to O
Dumont O
a O
few O
times O
now O

The O
food B
really O
isn't O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B
is O
terrible O

Maybe O
it's O
that O
most O
of O
Dumont's O
patrons O
are O
younger O
and O
have O
lower O
expectations O
but O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
Dumont O

Not O
only O
do O
they O
have O
the O
best O
escargot B
in O
townthey O
always O
try O
to O
accomodate O
our O

I've O
been O
to O
Sotto O
Voce O
several O
time O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
one O
place O
that O
hits O
the O
nail O
right O
on O
the O
head O
ever O
time O

Between O
my O
guest O
and O
I O
we O
sampled O
at O
least O
80% O
of O
the O
menu B
and O
they O
were O
all O
hits O

The O
Deco B
and O
ambiance B
was O
really O
romantic O

This O
is O
the O
best O
unknown O
restaurant O
in O
and O
around O
New O
York O

Just O
go O

Baluchi's O
has O
changed O
my O
mid O

Finally O
a O
curry B
that O
I O
can O
eat O
enjoy O
and O
not O
suffer O
from O
gastritis O
from O

lots O
of O
other O
Korean B
dishes I
that O
are O
affordable O

I O
went O
for O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
waiter B
efficient O
and O
courteous O
but O
also O
extremely O
helpful O
 
It O
took O
a O
bigger O
bite O
from O
my O
wallet O
than O
my O
appetite O
- O
I O
would O
not O
reccomend O
this O
to O
anyone O
that O
I O
would O
want O

the O

is O
warm O
and O
hospitable O
and O
the O

is O
outstanding O

I O
read O
about O

It's O

The O

are O
my O
favorites O

Sushi B
so O
fresh O
that O
it O
crunches O
in O
your O
mouth O

But O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
enough O
room O
on O
your O
credit O
card O
as O
the O
bill B
will O
leave O
a O
big O
dent O
in O
your O

Despite O
the O
5th O
ave O
address O
there O
are O
no O
frills O
whick O
I O
also O
love O

They O
bring O
a O
sauce B
cart I
up O
to O
your O
table B
and O
offer O
you O
up O
to O
7 O
or O
8 O
choices B
of I
sauces I
for O
your O
steak B
I O
tried O
them O
ALL O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
sushi B
fresh O
they O
also O
served O
other O
entrees B
allowed O
each O
guest O
something O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
we O
all O
left O
happy O
try O
the O
duck B

good O
variety B
but O
nothing O
surprising O

After O
I O
paid O
for O
my O
purchase O
I O
noticed O
they O
had O
not O
given O
me O
utensils B
so O
I O
could O
eat O
my O
pie B

Likewise O
if O
you O
like O
really O
thin B
crust I
or O
really O
big O
slices B
then O
Nick O
and O
Joe's O
may O
not O
be O
your O
favorite O

It's O
always O
quiet O
because O
it's O
awful O

No O
green B
beans I
no O

Chicken I

and O
Cinna B
Stix I

Thick O
fries B
meaty B
chili I
and O
stuffed B
baked I
potatoes I
round O
out O
a O
menu B
that O
includes O
a O
cool O
ultra-thick O
chocolate B
Frosty I

I O
always O
find O
myself O
asking O
the O
waiter B
to O
make O
something O
bland O
and O
different O
than O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu B

Good O
cake B
BUT: O
it O
was O
not O
the O
best O
cake B
i've O
ever O
had O
and O
definately O
not O
worth O
standing O
outside O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
being O
herded O
like O
cattle O
by O
indifferent O
and O
overworked O
employees B

The O
closest O
that O
I O
got O
was O
the O
Cherry B
Marscapone I
but O
they O
were O
out O
of O
it O
that O
day O

The O
homage O
to O
India O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
delectable O
roti B
canai I
appetizer I
a O
fried B
pancake I
served I
with I
pungent I
curry I
dipping I
sauce I
while O
the O
mango B
chicken I
offers O
a O
surprisingly O
sophisticated O
fresh O
take O
on O
sweet-and-sour O

It O
doesn't O
look O
like O
much O
on O
the O
outside B
but O
the O
minute O
you O
walk O
inside O
it's O
a O
whole O
other O
atmosphere B

I O
have O
to O
say O
the O
place O
was O
awesome O

The O
ground B
chickpea I
soup I
we O
sampled O
as O
a O
starter B
tasted O
somewhat O
thin O

We O
requested O
they O
re-slice O
the O
sushi B
and O
it O
was O
returned O
to O
us O
in O

The O
service B
however O
is O
a O
peg O
or O
two O
below O
the O
quality B
of I
food I
horrible O
bartenders B
and O
the O
clientele B
for O
the O
most O
part O
are O
rowdy O
loud-mouthed O
commuters O
this O
could O
explain O
the O
bad O
attitudes O
from O
the O
staff B
getting O
loaded O
for O
an O
AC/DC O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
definitely O
stop O
by O
for O
a O
great O
meal B

Unfortunately O
with O
our O
show O
tickets O
we O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
sample O
any O
desserts B

The O
restaurant O
could O
use O
a O
little O

all O

The O

Being O

a O
thing O
or O
two O
about O

this O

one O
of O
the O

I O
hope O

pizza B
Hanx O

Had O
dinner B
here O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
the O
food B
was O
great O

We O
recently O
spent O
New O
Year's O
Eve O
at O
the O
restaurant O
and O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
from O
the O
wine B
to O
the O
dessert B
menu I

Highly O
recommended O
 As O
stated O
I O
haven't O
dined O
*in* O
the O
restaurant O
but O
stopped O
by O
there O
to O
pick O
up O
takeout B
and O
it O
seems O
a O
very O
relaxing O
place; O
also O
the O
bar B
looks O
nice O

The O
ambiance B
was O
fine O
a O
little O
loud O
but O
still O
nice O
and O
romantic O

but O
the O
filet B
mignon I
was O
not O
very O
good O
at O
all O
cocktail B
hour I
includes O
free O
appetizers B
nice O
non-sushi B
selection I

It O
took O
about O
2 O
1/2 O
hours O
to O
be O
served B
our O
2 O
courses B

Who O
said O
go O
when O
the O
place B
is O
quiet O
during O
the O
day O

Can O
be O
a O
bit O
busy O
around O
peak O
times O
because O
of O
the O
size B

I O
was O
on O
jury O
duty O
rode O
my O
bike O
up O
Centre O
Street O
on O
my O
lunch O
break O
and O
came O
across O
this O
great O
little O
place B
with O
awesome O
chicken B
tacos I
and O
Hibiscus B
lemonade I

good O
place B
to O
hang O
out O
during O
the O
day O
after O
shopping O
or O
to O
grab O
a O
simple O
soup B
or O
classic O
french B
dish I
over O
a O
glass B
of I
wine I

Very O
nice O
touch O
that O
very O
much O
fits O
the O
place B

However O
there O
is O
just O
something O
so O
great O
about O
being O
outdoors B
in O
great O
landscaping O
enjoying O
a O
casual B
drink I
that O
makes O
going O
to O
this O
place B
worthwhile O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O
dance B
floor I

If O
you O
are O
here O
as O
a O
pre-show B
meal I
hop O
in O
a O
cab O
and O
take O
the O
extra O
10 O
minutes O
to O
go O
to O
the O
uptown O
location O

A O
plus O
was O
the O
good O
mix O
of O
people O
in O
their O
twenties O
that O
provided O
for O
great O
eye-candy O
while O
I O
was O
there O

The O
comments O
about O
fried B
foods I
is O
correct O
below O
but O
the O
other O
dishes B
including O
the O
lamb B
entree I
and O
many O
of O
the O
salads B
avocado I
shrimp I
were O
quite O
good O

It's O
best O
to O
go O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
with O
a O
close O
friend O
or O
a O
good O
book O

Slow O
service B
but O
when O
you're O
hanging O
around O
with O
groups O
of O
10 O
or O
20 O
who O
really O
notices O

The O
sauce B
is O
excellent O
very O
fresh O
with O
dabs B
of I
real I
mozzarella I

Don't O
ever O
bother O
- O
the O
drinks B
were O
awful O
but O
it O
was O
the O
people B
who O
work O
there O
that O
really O
made O
this O
the O
worst O
experience O
at O
dining B

The O
room B
is O
a O
little O
plain O
but O
it's O
difficult O
to O
make O
such O
a O
small O
place B
exciting O
and O
I O
would O
not O
suggest O
that O
as O
a O
reason O
not O
to O
go O

Prices B
even O
outside O
of O
restaurant O
week O
were O
great O

A O
small O
outdoor B
eating I
area I
makes O
for O
a O
private O
comfortable O
space B
to O
study O
alone O
or O
meet O
up O
with O
friends O

Before O
the O
place O
didn't O
call O
my O
attention O

And O
all O
the O
[female] B
servers I
are O
cute O
too O
which O
is O
always O
nice O

The O
best O
dessert B
a O
chocolate B
and I
peanut I
butter I
tart I
isn't O
particularly O
Hawaiian O
but O
it's O
a O
small O
world O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
sweets B

for O
an O
appetizer B
their O
calamari B
is O
a O
winner O

Satay O
is O
one O
of O
those O
favorite O
haunts O
on O
Washington O
where O
the O
service B
and O
food B
is O
always O
on O
the O
money O

After O
dinner B
I O
heard O
music B
playing O
and O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lounge B
downstairs O

But O
now O
that O
it's O
under O
new O
ownership O
and O
has O
been O
renovated O
it O
looks O
great O

The O
room B
is O
a O
gorgeous O
bi-level B
space I
and O
the O
long B
bar I
perfect O
for O
a O
drink B

Now O
we O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
state O
and O
every O
visit O
to O
NYC O
includes O
a O
stop O
here O

Two O
complaints- O
their O
appetizer B
selection I
stinks O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella B
sticks I
on O
the O
menu B

I O
don't O
remember O
what O
we O
had; O
nothing O
was O
memorable O

It O
is O
bland O
and O
nothing O
extrodinary O

I O
was O
especially O
impressed O
during O
the O
bday O
party O
when O
the O
waitstaff B
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
in O
helping O
me O
decorate O
and O
bring O
out O
a O
bday O
cake O
as O
well O
as O
offering O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
service B
to O
a O
15 O
person O
party O

The O
chicken B
and I
falafel I
platters I
were O
nondescript O
combinations O
with O
fresh B
leaf I
salad I

Every O
time O
I O
visit O
NYC O
I O
come O
here O

I've O
been O
coming O
here O
regularly O
since O
it O
opened O
about O
2 O
years O
ago O

The O
atmosphere B
takes O
you O
to O
that O
place O
the O
place O
many O
dream O
of O

several O
times O
and O
put O
up O
with O
the O
waiters' O
bad O
manners O
knowing O
that O
their O
job O
isn't O
easy O

The O
service B
is O
great O
maybe O
even O
borderline O
nagging O
but O
at O
least O
you O
get O
attention O
the O
desserts B
are O
excellent O
and O
the O
coffee B
is O
so O
very O
good O

We O
were O
seated O
next O
to O
a O
couple O
whose O
kitchen O
was O
being O
renovated O
and O
we O
agreed O
since O
we're O
all O
foodies O
who O
eat O
out O
a O
lot O
- O
that O
this O
wasn't O
a O
place O
we'd O
return O
to O

They O
are O
served B
on O
Focacchia B
bread I
and O
are O
to O
die O
for O

While O
the O
smoothies B
are O
a O
little O
big O
for O
me O
the O
fresh B
juices I
are O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
had O

The O
food B
is O
just O
OKAY O
and O
it's O
almost O
not O
worth O
going O
unless O
you're O
getting O
the O
pialla B
which O
is O
the O
only O
dish B
that's O
really O
good O

The O
guac B
is O
fresh B
yet I
lacking O
flavor B
we O
like O
to O
add O
our O
fresh B
salsa I
into O
it O

The O
new B
menu I
has O
a O
few O
creative O
itemsthey O
were O
smart O
enough O
to O
keep O
some O
of O
the O
old O
favorites O
but O
they O
raised O
the O
prices B
the O
staff B
is O
friendly O
most O
of O
the O
time O
but O
I O
must O
agree O
with O
the O
person O
that O
wrote O
about O
their O
favorite O
words: O
No O
can't O
sorry O
boy O
they O
won't O
bend O
the O
rules O
for O
anyone O

It' O
only O
open O
for O
lunch B
but O
the O
food B
is O
so O
good O

If O
you O
like O
seafood B
and/or O
Greek B
food I
you O
will O
love O
this O
place O
though O
it O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
just O
these O
things O

" O
The O
menu B
includes O
pub B
fare--burgers I
steaks B
and O
shepherds B
pie--and I
even O
a O
portabella B
lasagna I
for O
those O
black O
sheep O
known O
as O
"vegetarians O

How O
can O
they O
survive O
serving O
mediocre O
food B
at O
exorbitant O
prices B

The O
food B
was O
mediocre O
and O
the O
service B
was O
severely O
slow O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
on O
a O
different O
occasion O
- O
the O
food B
is O
mediocre O
for O
the O
prices B

I'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
back O
soon O
and O
eventually O
trying O
most O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B

I O
just O
had O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
place O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
and O
slowly O
work O
my O
way O
through O
the O
menu B

I O
asked O
repeatedly O
what O
the O
status O
of O
the O
meal B
was O
and O
was O
pretty O
much O
grunted O
at O
by O
the O
unbelievably O
rude O
waiter B

I O
stopped O
by O
for O
some O
brunch B
today O
and O
had O
the O
vegan B
cranberry I
pancakes I
and O
some O
rice B
milk I

Weekends O
can O
get O
crowded O
but O
still O
highly O
recommended O

It O
gets O
very O
crowded O
so O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
you O
get O
their O
early O

Sweet O
Irish O
bartender B
is O
always O
happy O
and O
able O
to O
bring O
a O
smile O
to O
my O
friends O
a O
my O
face O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
sitting O
next O
to O
someone O
in O
the O
theatre O
industry- O
interesting O
to O
hear O
ideas O
hashed O
out O
while O
having O
a O
quick O
bite O
to O
eat O

Its O
good O
to O
go O
there O
for O
drinks B
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
get O
drunk O
because O
you'll O
be O
lucky O
if O
you O
can O
get O
one O
drink B
an O
hour O
the O
service B
is O
so O
bad O

Anyway O
the O
owner B
was O
fake O

Owner B
is O
pleasant O
and O
entertaining O

I O
have O
never O
in O
my O
life O
sent O
back O
food B
before O
but O
I O
