But O
the O
staff B
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B
which O
was O
above O
average O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O

The O
food B
is O
uniformly O
exceptional O
with O
a O
very O
capable O
kitchen B
which O
will O
proudly O
whip O
up O
whatever O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
whether O
it's O
on O
the O
menu B
or O
not O

Where O
Gabriela O
personaly O
greets O
you O
and O
recommends O
you O
what O
to O
eat O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
food B
outstanding O
but O
the O
little O
'perks' O
were O
great O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O

Our O
agreed O
favorite O
is O
the O
orrechiete B
with I
sausage I
and I
chicken I
usually O
the O
waiters B
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish B
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats B

The O
Bagels B
have O
an O
outstanding O
taste O
with O
a O
terrific O
texture O
both O
chewy O
yet O
not O
gummy O

Nevertheless O
the O
food B
itself O
is O
pretty O
good O

i've O
noticed O
megadeth O
mr O
scruff O
st O
germain O
traditional O
vietnamese O
songs B
black O
sabbath O
jay-z O
and O
daft O
punk O
all O
being O
played O

They O
did O
not O
have O
mayonnaise B
forgot O
our O
toast B
left O
out O
ingredients B
ie O
cheese B
in O
an O
omelet B
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B
was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate B
when O
you O
touched O
it O

It O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
check B
which O
was O
perfect O
since O
we O
could O
sit O
have O
drinks B
and O
talk O

The O
design B
and O
atmosphere B
is O
just O
as O
good O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine B

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
Mary's O
and O
am O
making O
it O
one O
of O
my O
regular O
neighborhood O
haunts O

The O
pizza B
is O
the O
best O
if O
you O
like O
thin B
crusted I
pizza B

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O

He O
can't O
help O
they're O
bought O
up O
so O
fast O

Secondly O
on O
this O
night O
the O
place O
was O
overwhelmed O
by O
upper O
east O
side O
ladies O
perfume O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O

Obviously O
run O
by O
folks O
who O
know O
a O
pie O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O

IT O
IS O
DEFINITELY O
SPECIAL O
AND O
AFFORDABLE O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O

All O
the O
money O
went O
into O
the O
interior B
decoration I
none O
of O
it O
went O
to O
the O
chefs B

The O
seats B
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O

I O
asked O
for O
seltzer B
with I
lime I
no O
ice O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O

Will O
not O
be O
back O

Don't O
go O
alone---even O
two O
people O
isn't O
enough O
for O
the O
whole O
experience O
with O
pickles B
and O
a O
selection B
of I
meats I
and I
seafoods I

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat B
family I
style I
because O
you'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes B

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B
the O
owner B
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B
is O
fast O

This O
isn't O
a O
value O
joint O

Faan's O
got O
a O
great O
concept O
but O
a O
little O
rough O
on O
the O
delivery B

From O
the O
incredible O
food B
to O
the O
warm O
atmosphere B
to O
the O
friendly O
service B
this O
downtown O
neighborhood O
spot O
doesn't O
miss O
a O
beat O

Great O
food B
at O
REASONABLE O
prices B
makes O
for O
an O
evening O
that O
can't O
be O
beat O

Look O
foward O
to O
trying O
the O
Ruben O
upon O
returning O

The O
only O
other O
steakhouse O
that O
seems O
to O
hold O
a O
candle O
to O
Roth's O
is O
the O
Strip O
House O

We O
usually O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
anniversary O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior B
decor I
and O
affordable O
city O
prices B

You'll O
adore O
it O

Two O
words: O
Free O
wine B

The O
price B
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B
is O
poor O

The O
quantity B
is O
also O
very O
good O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth's O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st O
Ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
LA O
Being O
serious O
sushi B
lovers O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O

Raga's O
is O
a O
romantic O
cozy O
restaurant O

The O
fried B
rice I
is O
amazing O
here O

Three O
courses B
- O
choices O
include O
excellent O
mussels B
puff B
pastry I
goat I
cheese I
and O
salad B
with I
a I
delicious I
dressing I
and O
a O
hanger B
steak I
au I
poivre I
that O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B
food I

The O
place B
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O

At O
the O
end O
you're O
left O
with O
a O
mild O
broth B
with I
noodles I
that O
you O
can O
slurp O
out O
of O
a O
cup O

I O
just O
wonder O
how O
you O
can O
have O
such O
a O
delicious O
meal B
for O
such O
little O
money B

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
excellent O

so O
garantuan O
that O
you O
can't O
fit O
them O
in O
a O
toaster O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai B
restaurants I
in O
Manhattan O
before O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai B
food I
Ive O
had O
except O
for O
my O
mom's O
of O
course O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass B
of I
wine I
before O
offering O
another O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia O
pizza O

Whem O
asked O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
more O
detailed O
questions O
so O
that O
we O
knew O
what O
the O
specials B
were O

This O
is O
a O
consistently O
great O
place O
to O
dine B
for O
lunch B
or O
dinner B

Nice O
atmosphere B
the O
service B
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B
was O
good O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table B
and O
had O
dinner B

Fabulous O
service B
fantastic O
food B
and O
a O
chilled O
out O
atmosphere B
and O
environment B

Not O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
hear O

Try O
the O
lasagnette B
appetizer I

Pricey O
but O
worth O
a O
try O
at O
least O
once O

I've O
been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
and O
I O
usually O
end O
up O
sitting O
next O
to O
some O
pretty O
odd O
people O

I O
liked O
the O
beer B
selection I

Great O
food B
good O
size O
menu B
great O
service B
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining B
experience O

Can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O

I O
grew O
up O
eating O
Dosa B
and O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
NY O
to O
satisfy O
my O
taste O
buds O

Wine B
list I
selection I
is O
good O
and O
wine-by-the-glass B
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B
 I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
 
The O
menu B
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees B

If O
you O
are O
a O
carnivore O
come O
hungry O
and O
you O
will O
leave O
more O
satisfied O
than O
you O
have O
ever O
been O

The O
menu B
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B
are O
excellent O

Not O
too O
crazy O
about O
their O
sake B
martini I

Great O
bagels B
spreads B
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O

The O
service B
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they're O
very O
nice O
and O
sometimes O
not O

whoever O
the O
jazz O
duo O
was O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O

One O
thing O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
place O
is O
that O
I O
never O
felt O
rushed O
or O
pressured O
to O
give O
up O
my O
table B
ot O
incoming O
guests O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
bargain O

We O
happened O
upon O
this O
place O
purely O
by O
accident O
and O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O

Unfortunately O
the O
food B
is O
outstanding O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
pits O

Deff O
recimmend O
Bukhara O
they O
also O
have O
opened O
two O
new O
locations O
guess O
ill O
try O
them O
out O

We O
always O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal B
and O
always O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O

Dip O
the O
ingredients B
in O
with O
your O
chopsticks B
swirl O
them O
around O
and O
eat O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B
terrace I

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O

Everyone O
I O
have O
spoken O
too O
there O
is O
super O
friendly O
helpful O
and O
willing O
to O
the O
extra O
mile O
for O
a O
customer O

The O
pizza B
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O

Sapphire O
is O
the O
only O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
go O
to O
when O
I'm O
in O
NYC O

The O
cuisine B
from O
what O
I've O
gathered O
is O
authentic O
Taiwanese O
though O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I've O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
Taipei O

I O
heartily O
recommend O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
in O
NYC O
to O
make O
new O
friends O
and O
catch O
up O
with O
old O
ones O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O

They O
are O
often O
crowded B
on O
the O
weekends O
but O
they O
are O
efficient O
and O
accurate O
with O
their O
service B

All O
my O
co-workers O
were O
amazed O
at O
how O
small O
the O
dish B
was O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
unheralded O
the O
service B
impecible O
and O
the O
food B
magnificant O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
grilled B
branzino I
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B
has O
gotten O
better O
and O
better O

This O
place O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
is O
perhaps O
Queens' O
biggest O
secret O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed B
on O
weekends O
but O
the O
vibe B
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B
food I
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O

This O
place O
is O
so O
much O
fun O

I O
was O
glad O
I O
did O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B
with O
good O
pizza B

I've O
never O
been O
treated O
so O
rudely O

I'll O
be O
back O
soon O

Le O
Pere O
Pinard O
has O
a O
$15 O
pre-theater B
menu I
that O
is O
outstanding O

Went O
inside O
and O
I O
started O
to O
get O
excited O

I O
also O
ordered O
for O
delivery B
and O
the O
restaurant O
forgot O
half O
the O
order B

Our O
server B
checked O
on O
us O
maybe O
twice O
during O
the O
entire O
meal B

However O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O

We O
have O
been O
to O
Montparnasse O
many O
times O
and O
return O
often O
for O
good O
reason O

The O
strong O
scents B
coming O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
of O
me O
negatively O
affected O
my O
taste O
buds O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B
sandwich I
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O

It's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O

If O
you O
wrote O
a O
bad O
review O
it's O
because O
you O
don't O
understand O
what O
Rao's O
is O
all O
about O

Had O
we O
been O
stalling O
I O
could O
understand O
where O
they O
were O
coming O
from O
but O
we O
had O
been O
there O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
they O
hadn't O
even O
brought O
us O
a O
check B
yet O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

Though O
the O
Spider B
Roll I
may O
look O
like O
a O
challenge O
to O
eat O
with O
soft O
shell B
crab I
hanging O
out O
of O
the O
roll O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price B
you O
pay O
for O
them O

Deep B
Fried I
Skewers I
are O
good O
and O
still O
rare O
to O
find O
in O
NYC O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B
but O
both O
times O
the O
hostess B
didn't O
have O
my O
name O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B
dishes I
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B
rice B
porridge I

Their O
tuna B
tartar I
appetizer I
is O
to O
die O
for O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
BEST O
restaurants O
I've O
ever O
been O
to O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
pretty O
decent O

An O
oasis O
of O
refinement: O
 Food B
though O
somewhat O
uneven O
often O
reaches O
the O
pinnacles O
of O
new O
American O
fine O
cuisine B
- O
chef's O
passion O
and O
kitchen's O
precise O
execution O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
fish B
dishes I
and O
soups B

If O
you O
love O
wine B
and O
cheese B
and O
delicious O
french B
fare I
you'll O
love O
Artisanal O

I O
love O
Indian B
food I
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O

Some O
baby B
pizzas I
get O
their O
wish O

Plenty O
of O
choices O
to O
make O
your O
own O
creation O

It O
was O
tiny O
and O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
eating O
in O
someone's O
living O
room O

I O
was O
there O
on O
sat O

Overall O
A O
oh O
ya O
even O
though O
there O
is O
waiting B
it O
is O
deff O
worth O
it O

The O
lava B
cake I
dessert I
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O

VT O
is O
what O
baby B
pizzas I
hope O
to O
be O
when O
they O
grow O
up O

From O
the O
terrible O
service B
to O
the O
bland O
food B
not O
to O
mention O
the O
unaccommodating O
managers B
the O
overall O
experience O
was O
horrible O

Lahore O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
duck O
into O
late-night O
when O
you O
need O
some O
really O
tasty O
food B
on O
the O
cheap O
-- O
you'll O
likely O
have O
trouble O
finishing O
the O
amount O
of O
food B
you O
get O
for O
FOUR O
DOLLARS O

The O
last O
time O
I O
went O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
a O
table B
in O
a O
corridor O
next O
to O
the O
kitchen O

good O
selection B
of I
wines I
ranging O
from O
affordable O
to O
high O
end O

Nice O
restaurant O
overall O
with O
classic O
upscale O
Italian B
decor I

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B

The O
entire O
dining B
experience I
was O
wonderful O

The O
wine B
selection I
by O
the O
glass O
and O
bottle O
is O
wonderful O
and O
I O
always O
recommend O
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B
if O
they're O
going O
to O
be O
in O
town O

Service B
is O
highly O
refined: O
our O
seating O
was O
delayed O
35 O
minutes O
past O
our O
reservation B
and O
the O
maitre B
d' O
apologized O
and O
regularly O
kept O
us O
apprised O
of O
progress O

Order O
the O
panang B
duck I
it's O
fantastic O

Food B
is O
usually O
very O
good O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B
vegatables I
in O
side O
orders O

Other O
than O
the O
crappy O
service B
from O
two O
individuals O
it's O
great O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O

Wondering O
who O
had O
the O
best O
deals O
we O
noticed O
a O
line O
had O
formed O
to O
wait O
for O
this O
one O
particular O
establishment O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B
at O
amazin O
prices B

You O
are O
treated O
just O
like O
royality O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
or O
more O

Ambiance- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O

I've O
never O
felt O
more O
unwelcome O
than O
last O
month O
at O
Jimmy's O
Bronx O
Cafe O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B
Salmon I
Sea B
Bass I
and O
Crispy B
Duck I

Yes O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients B
don't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B
right O

Looking O
from O
the O
outside O
in O
one O
would O
hesitate O
to O
enter O
this O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
really O
that's O
what O
it O
is O

and O
yes O
Dal B
Bukhara I
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating B
here O
again O

I've O
been O
coming O
here O
as O
a O
child O
and O
always O
come O
back O
for O
the O
taste B

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
those O
comfortable O
neighborhood O
joints O
where O
you O
know O
you O
will O
always O
have O
a O
good O
meal B
at O
a O
fair O
price B

A O
glass B
of I
Leaping I
Lizard O
a O
glass B
of I
prosecco I
and O
the O
mussels B
had O
everything O
happy O

Food B
was O
average O
and O
creme B
brulee I
was O
awful O
- O
the O
sugar B
was O
charred O
not O
caramelized O
and O
smelled O
of O
kerosene O

The O
food B
always O
tastes O
fresh O
and O
served B
promptly O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O

The O
pizza B
here O
is O
delicious O

My O
entire O
family O
was O
horrified O

On O
a O
monthly O
basis O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
get O
together O
and O
have O
a O
girls O
night O
out O

Pizza B
and O
garlic B
knots I
are O
great O
as O
well O
I O
order O
from O
them O
quite O
often O
and O
the O
delivery B
is O
always O
super O
quick O

For O
great O
chinese B
food I
nearby O
you O
have O
Wu O
Liang O
Ye O
and O
Grand O
Sichuan O
just O
a O
block O
away O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B

This O
place O
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
 restaurant O
the O
food B

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red O
Eye O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B

This O
should O
have O
been O
done O
in O
a O
back O
room O
- O
away O
from O
customers O

Service B
could O
be O
improved O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
the O
heavy O
black O
antique-seeming O
teapot B
for O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O

Glad O
you O
have O
the O
luxury O
to O
throw O
out O
paying O
customers O

The O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B
mozzarella I
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
frozen O
shredded O
cheese B
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O

Its O
an O
excellent O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
the O
food B
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
of O
New O
York O

service B
is O
friendly O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting B
a I
table I

The O
atmosphere B
was O
crowded O
but O
it O
was O
a O
great O
bistro-type B
vibe I

Check O
it O
out O

First O
off O
the O
waitress B
was O
completely O
unattentive O
the O
2 O
times O
we O
saw O
herodd O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
6 O
tables B
and O
got O
our O
order O
wrong O

Don't O
go O

The O
food B
was O
bland O
oily O

But O
they O
do O

What O
is O
even O
better O
is O
that O
the O
prices B
are O
very O
affordable O
as O
well O
and O
the O
food B
is O
really O
good O

The O
fish B
is O
fresh O
but O
the O
variety B
of I
fish B
is O
nothing O
out O
of O
ordinary O

Look O
I O
dont O
know O
if O
the O
people O
who O
wrote O
the O
reviews O
have O
ever O
been O

a O
decent O
place O

Our O
favorite O
meal B
is O
a O
pesto B
pizza I
the O

and O
a O
good O
bottle B
of I
wine I

And O
Kruno O
the O
beverage B
manager I
is O
the O
best O
bartender B
I O
have O
yet O
to O
come O
across O

Ambiance B
and O
music B
funky O
which O
I O
enjoy O

The O
food B
drinks B
and O
service B
are O
clearly O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food B
and O
refleshment B
with O
my O
date O

It's O
a O
really O
great O
deal O
considering O
we O
got O
full O
off O
of O
four O
dollars O

I O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic O
alluring O
ambiance B
or O
the O
five O

featuring O
a O

tandoori B
salmon I

I O
am O
completely O
hooked O
on O
this O
place O
it O
is O
ridiculous O

Eating O
in O
the O
atmosphere B
saves O
it O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
it's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O

Granted O
the O
space B
is O
smaller O
than O
most O
it O
is O
the O
best O

you O
will O
find O
in O
even O
the O

It O
could O
have O

handled O
better O

The O
service B
was O
attentive O
and O
her O
suggestions O
of O
menu B

was O
right O
on O
the O

The O
other O

we O
had O
the O

everything O
was O

if O

father's O
uncle's O
legacies O
with O
a O
smile O
true O
love O
for O
his O
community O
and O
let's O
not O
forget O
the O
Outstanding O
Pizza B

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O

The O
environment B
is O
romantic O
but O
the O
food B
is O
horrible O
the O
service B
is O
pathetic O
and O
gabriella O
lies O
about O
everything O
she O
could O

We O
had O
crawfish B
boiled I
and O
despite O
making O
a O
mess O
it O
was O
a O
ton O
of O
fun O
and O
quite O
tasty O
as O
well O

I O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
for O
this O
place O
and O
made O
a O
reservation B
a O
couple O
of O
months O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O

What O
came O
to O
our O
table B
was O
burned O
beyond O
recognition O
and O
stringy O

I O
had O
the O
Pad B
Thai I
and O
the O
noodles B
were O
sticky O

So O
I've O
never O
actually O
been O
to O
M O
proper O
but O
I've O
had O
it O
delivered B
a O
few O
times O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values B
for I
your I
money I

Frankly O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch B
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O

The O
hostess B
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O

If O
you're O
craving O
for O
Haru's O
great O
food B
especially O
the O
House O
Roll O
but O
can't O
stand O
the O
wait B
building I
outisde O
head O
across O
the O
street O
to O
their O
Sake O
Bar O

A O
narrow O
corridor B
leads O
to O
a O
tiny O
space B
where O
there O
are O
three O
tiny O
white O
tiled O
counters B
a O
great O
deal O
of O
mess O
stacks O
of O
bottles O
cans O
and O
a O
small O
counter B
holding O
12-14 O
entrees B

The O
food B
is O
great O

Succulent O
steaks B
cooked O
precisely O
to O
your O
desired O
'doneness' O
accompanied O
by O
salads B
and O
sides B
that O
don't O
look O
like O
leafy O
road O
kill O

Lunch B
came O
with O
pickels B
and I
slaw I
no O
extra O
charge O

Decent O
wine B
at O
reasonable O
prices B

All O
conveniently O
delivered B
right O
to O
the O
door O

even O
the O
wine B
by I
the I
glass I
was O
good O

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant O

would O
have O
rather O
tried O
terrace O
in O
the O
sky O
or O
water O
club O
for O
that O
price B

This O
dish B
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B
Mojito I
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O

Okay O
service B

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B
which O
is O
exceptional O
is O
the O
service B

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O

The O
food B
was O
just O
awful O
ATROCIOUS O
actually O

I O
will O
never O
visit O
this O
restaurant O
again O

The O
soup B
for I
the I
udon I
was O
soy B
sauce I
and O
water B

The O
anti-pasta B
was O
excellent O
especially O
the O
calamari B
as O
were O
the O
filling B
pasta I
mains I

The O
waitress B
suggested O
glasses B
of I
wine I
that O
went O
very O
well O
with O
the O
food B

or O
sister O
in O
my O
case O

I've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O

They O
might O
be O
all O
business O
at O
the O
counter B
when O
you O
give O
your O
order O
but O
their O
food B
says O
I O
love O
you O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included: O
ceviche B
mix I
special I
crab B
dumplings I
assorted B
sashimi I
sushi B
and O
rolls B
two O
types O
of O
sake B
and O
the O
banana B
tempura I

Try O
their O
plain B
pizza I
with O
fresh O
garlic B
or O
eggplant B

Don't O
go O
there O

Ok O
so O
the O
servers B
wander O
around O
a O
little O
clueless O
but O
there's O
more O
than O
enough O
servers B
for O
the O
crowd O
they O
get O
-- O
it's O
fine O
you O
just O
have O
to O
make O
a O
small O
effort O
to O
get O
their O
attention O

Good O
luck O
getting B
a I
table I

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O

Don't O
look O
down O
your O
nose O
at O
me O
like O
that O

Planet O
Thai O
is O
great O

The O
service B
is O
awful O

Just O
don't O
do O
it O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O

The O
takeout B
menu B
says O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
an O
expanded O
menu B
offering O
more O
italian B
dishes I
I O
can't O
wait O

Trust O
me O
it O
will O
be O
great O
and O
all O
of O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O
in O
no O
time O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
OG O
again O
last O
night O

I O
wish O
they O
had O
one O
near O
my O
office- O
I O
would O
go O
everyday O

Finally O

Amma O
has O
the O
worst O
value O
for O
money O
I O
have O
experienced O
in O
NYC O
over O
the O
past O
2 O
years O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai B
food I
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O

I O
think O
this O
would O
be O
a O
pretty O
good O
spot O
if O
it O
were O
not O
so O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
are O
two O
people O
or O
two O
hundred O
people O
ahead O
of O
you O
the O
hostess B
will O
take O
your O
name O
and O
tell O
you O
Five O
minutes O

The O
pizza B
is O
good O
though O

bottles B
of I
wine I
are O
cheap O
and O
good O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O

Walk-ins O
are O
risky O
too O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish B
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B
tortelini I

They O
didn't O
give O
us O
the O
dinner B
special I
until O
we O
asked O
for O
it O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B
lasagna I
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B
bread I
pudding I
for O
dessert B

word O
of O
advice O
save O
room O
for O
pasta B
dishes I
and O
never O
leave O
until O
you've O
had O
the O
tiramisu B

Very O
good O
service B
and O
very O
good O
prices B

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch B
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O

The O
service B
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
-- O
the O
staff B
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
know O
their O
menu B
present O
your O
meal B
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O

Ess-A-Bagel O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
NY O

Our O
food B
was O
great O
too O

Open O
late O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I'm O
a O
night O
person O

The O
most O
annoying O
thing O
though O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
servers B
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
to O
drive O
revenue O

Get O
your O
food B
to O
go O
find O
a O
bench O
and O
kick O
back O
with O
a O
plate B
of I
dumplings I

Please O
try O
the O
Filet B
Mignon I
its O
just O
the O
most O
tender O
piece O
ever O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
pretty O
good O
but O
we O
have O
only O
been O
there O
once O

We O
were O
still O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar B
while O
we O
drank O
the O
sangria B
but O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
bar B
when O
we O
turned O
back O
around O
the O
$2 O
was O
gone O
the O
people O
next O
to O
us O
said O
the O
bartender B
took O
it O

Something O
about O
them O
being O
busy O
with O
holiday O
party's O

The O
sake B
menu I
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O

This O
place O
is O
great O

the O
drinks B
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8pm O

i've O
been O
back O
to O
nha O
trang O
literally O
a O
hundred O
times O
for O
the O
beef B
cubes I
- O
they're O
that O
good O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O

The O
service B
wine B
selection I
ambiance B
are O
all O
outstanding O
and O
deserve O
recognition O

Went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
2 O
year O
anniversery O
and O
wasn't O
all O
that O
impressed O

It O
was O
rather O
pathetic O
that O
it O
took O
them O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
seat O
us O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly O
as O
we O
had O
reservations B
however O
after O
that O
the O
service B
was O
slow O

At O
first O
I O
was O
slightly O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
NYC O

It's O
really O
also O
the O
service B
is O
good O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
friendly O

Suan O
was O
a O
recommendation O
that O
I O
am O
glad O
we O
heeded O

The O
food B
was O
pretty O
good O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions B
very O
small O
including O
dessert B

We O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it's O
on O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B
noise I

Also O
the O
place O
is O
popular O
with O
families O
so O
if O
you're O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O

I'll O
keep O
this O
short O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O

Lived O
in O
Shanghai O
most O
of O
my O
life O
and O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
comparable O
to O
the O
flagship O
Green O
Bo O
restaurant O
there O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
Bart's O
for O
their O
food B
the O
ambience B
and O
wonderful O
service B

However O
it's O
not O
worth O
a O
special O
trip O

Nice O
value O

Gigino's O
in O
Wagner O
Park O
is O
so O
enjoyable O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner B
meeting I
with O
business O
associates O

All O
the O
NYU O
students O
love O
this O
place O
so O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere B

The O
food B
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
Cantonese B
that O
is O

But O
nothing O
stands O
out O
about O
the O
cooking B

Joya O
used O
to O
be O
a O
cool O
spot O
with O
decent O
food B
and O
a O
colorful O
- O
if O
not O
relaxed O
- O
atmosphere B

If O
that's O
a O
problem O
go O
to O
McDonald's O
and O
destroy O
your O
insides O

The O
Prix B
Fixe I
menu I
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
both O
in O
quantity B
AND O
quality B

I've O
been O
here O
3 O
times O
for O
lunch B
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
in O
the O
city O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B
benedict I
for O
brunch B
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B
sauce I
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O

I O
work O
near-by O
and O
they O
have O
the O
BEST O
oatmeal B
in O
the O
neighborhood- O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick-cooked O
item O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O

The O
menu B
looked O
good O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
Chilean B
Sea I
Bass I
but O
the O
server B
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials B
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O

Sexy O

The O
food B
was O
really O
good O
I O
had O
the O
onion B
soup I
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ever O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
this O
Bengali O
Fast O
Food O
joint O
is O
clearly O
my O
favorite O

I'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O

overall O
a O
solid O
restaurant O
and O
at O
less O
than O
$40pp O
including O
wine B
a O
solid O
deal O
as O
well O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
it's O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff B
welcomes O
you O
- O
don't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner B
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
but O
definitely O
not O
for O
Dim B
Sum I
again O

It O
costs O
$2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll B
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll B
but O
the O
roll B
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice B

Even O
with O
John's O
and O
Joe's O
around O
the O
corner O
this O
place O
will O
make O
a O
name O
for O
itself O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy O
creamy O
and O
slightly O
buttery O

When O
he O
finally O
did O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
make O
a O
gin B
and I
tonic B
-- O
couldn't O
find O
tonic B

My O
girlfriend O
convinced O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
other O
night O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O

The O
dim B
sum I
is O
ok O
but O
doesn't O
taste O
that O
fresh O
and O
the O
little B
dishes I
don't O
look O
steamy O
hot O
as O
they O
should O
also O
note O
lack O
of O
Chinese O
here O

despite O
the O
untasteful O
previous O
review O

Don't O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O
facie O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O

Sure O
everyone's O
got O
their O
favorite O
but O
to O
know O
Sal O
is O
to O
know O
New O
York O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O

Also O
they O
were O
$15 O
each O

The O
service B
is O
ok O
some O
of O
the O
people O
didn't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation B
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B
Chicken I
special I
with I
Edamame I
Puree I

This O
is O
as O
good O
as O
neighborhood O
restaurants O
come O

If O
you O
want O
some O
roast B
duck I
pork B
or O
chicken B
on I
rice I
with I
ginger I
try O
them O
out O

You O
order O
from O
a O
menu B
so O
you O
leave O
feeling O
like O
you O
missed O
the O
full O
experience O

One O
of O
the O
more O
authentic O
Shanghainese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
US O
definitely O
the O
best O
in O
Manhattan O
Chinatown O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O

we O
love O
th O
pink O
pony O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O

Staff B
is O
very O
accomodating O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O

--Eat O
Club O
is O
a O
roving O
group O
of O
NYC O
gluttons O

If O
you O
were O
there O
when O
it O
first O
opened O
give O
this O
restaurant O
a O
second O
chance O

I O
went O
to O
Del O
Frisco's O
Friday O
night O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
an O
8:00 O
reservation B

If O
you O
like O
Sakagura O
but O
you O
feel O
it's O
too O
much O
you'd O
better O
try O
Yokocho O

yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
have O
dinner B
here O
and O
see O
if O
you O
dont O
agree O
with O
me O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot O
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O

Very O
popular O
style O
Izakaya O
Sake B
and O
small O
portion B
of O
sake-friendly O
dishes B
 
Hurley's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O

Not O
pretentious O
and O
very O
economical O

The O
food B
was O
terrific O
and O
the O
service B
classy O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
place O
to O
try O
some O
roti B
rolls I

Fresh O
ingredients B
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O

We O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
charging O
the O
meal B
or O
the O
tip B
and O
the O
food B
was O
delivered O
quickly O
but O
we O
live O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
walk O
from O
them O

Quick O
and O
friendly O
service B

Authentic O
bistro O

They O
are O
tasty O
but O
I O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat B
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
American O
digestive O
system O

Somewhat O
pricey O
but O
what O
the O
heck O

It's O
true O
this O
place O
is O
not O
cheap O

Try O
the O
hot B
dogs I
too O
they're O
snappy O
and O
delicious O

Delivery B
is O
fast O
too O

Being O
from O
the O
south O
there O
aren't O
any O
good O
delis O
in O
my O
area O
and O
while O
watching O
Foods O
across O
America O
on O
PBS O
I O
found O
out O
about O
Katz's O
Deli O

The O
noise B
level I
was O
unbearable O
conversation O
impossible O

Personal B
pans I
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O

Highly O
recommended O
is O
the O
Spicy B

One O
of O
the O
earlier O
people O
commenting O
on O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
get O
the O
that O
some O
experimenting O
is O
going O
on O
with O
the O
menu B
in O
a O
positive O
way O

It's O
convenient O

Thanks O
Bloom's O
for O
a O
lovely O
trip O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
great O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
laid O
back O
scene O
and O
an O
inexpensive O
way O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O
afternoon O

Oh O
right O
I O
should O
probably O
say O
something O
nice O

Odd O
for O
Ave O
B O
not O
just O
odd O
The O
place B
attracts O
an O
eclectic O
crowd O
to O
say O
the O
least O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O

Instead O
of O
wasting O

just O
got O

it O

its O

also O
very O

to O

much O
overpraised O
and O
underdeserving O

The O
man B
that O
was O
hosting O
promised O
to O
save O
a O

for O
our O
party O

then O
sat O
a O

As O
we O
were O
sitting O
eating O
the O
subpar O

the O
manager B
proceeded O
to O
berate O

Go O
here O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O

on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O

Rosario's O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
pizzerias O
in O
existence O

Decor B
is O
nice O
and O
minimalist O
food B
simple O
yet O
very O
well O
presented O
and O
cooked O
and O
the O
wine B
list I
matches O
the O
food B
very O
well O

I O
had O
the O
salmon B
dish I
and O
while O
it O
was O
fine O
for O
the O
price B
paid O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
flavor B

We O
ordered O
a O
tuna B
melt I
- O
it O
came O
with O
out O
cheese B
which O
just O
made O
it O
a O
tuna B
sandwich I

Especially O
liked O
chicken B
tikka I
and O
the O
naan B
and O
the O
dals B

The O
waiters B
were O
not O
attentive O
except O
that O
the O
bill B
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O

The O
restaurant O
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns B
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
staff B
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O

We O
generally O
like O
good O
restaurants O
and O
eat O
out O
often O
but O
Kai O
was O
way O
to O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
got O

What O
a O
great O
place O

The O
sangria B
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O

Don't O
eat O
here O
unless O
you're O
starving O
for O
thai B
food I
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg O
spot O
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B
plus O
great O
service B
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B
ever O

While O
the O
menu B
isn't O
especially O
groundbreaking O
everything O
I've O
tried O
so O
far O
has O
been O
well-executed O
and O
tasty O

Ive O
been O
here O
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
now O
and O
the O
service B
is O
always O
outstanding O

The O
bill B
is O
approximately O
$25 O
for O
2 O
at O
lunch B
without O
drinks B

Quite O
frankly O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B
I O
have O
ever O
tried O

The O
food B
is O
great O
service B
is O
ok O

The O
overall O
price B
tag I
was O
very O
very O
expensive O
something O
I O
did O
expect O

By O
the O
time O
we O
were O
done O
it O
was O
past O
1:00am O

Spice O
is O
great O
Thai B
food I
love O
the O
inexpensive O
appetizers B

Read O
all O
the O
other O
review O
they'll O
confirm O
it O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O

The O
service B
was O
attentive O

He O
not O
only O
makes O
his O
own O
homemade O
mozzarella B
but O
every O
pie B
is O
ultra O
fresh O

Fish B
was O
overdone O

Great O
idea O
and O
base O
for O
restaurant O
but O
work O
on O
the O
details O
people O
who O
think O
this O
was O
good O
need O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
shore O
towns O
and O
rethink O
what O
it O
should O
have O
tasted O
like O

When O
you're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B
dining I
room I
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
hand-painted O
high O
ceiling B
you'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O

We O
visited O
Bread O
Bar O
during O
January O
restaurant O
week O
and O
were O
so O
pleased O
with O
the O
menu B
selections I
and O
service B

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music B
being O
piped O
in O
- O
quite O
a O
weird O
selection O

You O
could O
get O
a O
much O
better O
dining O
experience O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
French O
Bistros O

The O
establishment B
scores O
big O
points O
in O
presentation O
and O
style O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B
sum I
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
is O
worth O
it O

Good O
food B

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
very O
friendly O
if O
not O
overly O
efficient O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O

The O
dim B
sum I
however O
was O
very O
good O

It's O
better O
than O
being O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
Sutton O
Place O
with O
19 O
year O
old O
interns O
jabbing O
you O
in O
the O
ribs O
all O
night O

Service B
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
and O
efficient O

Went O
there O
and O
had O
a O
combination O
of O
different O
seafood B
dishes I
and O
appetizers B

Its O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
casual O
date O
or O
to O
entertain O
clients O
for O
lunch B

All O
we O
received O
was O
an O
apology O
as O
we O
left O
to O
see O
our O
show O
without O
dinner B

The O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
if O
he O
crushed O
the O
grapes B
himself O
when O
their O
long O
overdue O
bottle B
of I
wine I
finally O
arrived O

Prices B
are O
very O
good O

We O
could O
not O
catch O
our O
waiter's O
eye O
and O
he O
ignored O
us O

Fantastic O
place O

Plain O
and O
simple O
it's O
bad O
thai B
food I

Definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant O
to O
skip O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O

Usually O
3 O
vs O
4 O
items O
per O
dish B

While O
certain O
staples B
are O
excellent O
the O
burger B
some O
of O
the O
pastas B
the O
food B
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O

The O
Dim B
Sum I
was O
so-so O
but O
not O
spectacular O

The O
food B
was O
so-so O

The O
waitress B
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O

The O
place B
is O
larger O
than O
most O
and O
features O
adequate O
seating B
unlike O
most O
joints O
and O
has O
a O
bar B
which O
deserves O
a O
mention O

What O
a O
ripoff O

Threw O

was O
a O
small O
wait B
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O

The O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
$24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price B

May O
the O
owner B
always O
has O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
and O
will O
warmly O
greet O
you O

I've O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place O
has O
it O
all O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O

The O
sides B
were O
ok O
and O
incredibly O
salty O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

For O
some O
reason O
all O
the O
seafood B
on O
the O
menu B
was O
unavailable O
except O
for O
the O
Salmon B

Not O
a O
large O
place B
but O
it's O
cute O
and O
cozy O

Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O

and O
there's O
no O
way O
out O

The O
beverages B
were O
excellent O
and O
the O
dessert B
was O
good O

The O
hostess B
and O
the O
waitress B
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O

Next O
time O
we O
wouldn't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian B
appetizers I
and O
drinks B

Please O
if O
your O
thinking O
about O
it O
go O
and O
stay O
the O
wait B
you O
won't O
be O
disappointed O

I O
must O
say O
the O
view B
of O
NYC O
is O
so O
beautiful O

If O
you'd O
like O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
light O
meal B
with O
an O
asian O
accent O
Long O
Tan O
is O
a O
good O
place O
on O
the O
slope O

When O
going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner B
I O
like O
a O
nice O
ambiance B
as O
well O
as O
very O
good O
food B

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
I O
say O
good O
- O
stay O
out O

Otherwise O
this O
place O
has O
great O
service B
and O
prices B
and O
a O
nice O
friendly O
atmosphere B

Highly O
recommend O
this O
as O
great O
value B
for O
excellent O
sushi B
and O
service B

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served B
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service B

A++ O
  The O
service B
was O
good O
to O
excellent O
along O
with O
the O
attitude B

This O
is O
my O
fourth O
try O
over O
a O
two O
year O
period O
and O
I'm O
done O

The O
food B
is O
awesome O
- O
definitely O
try O
the O
striped B
bass I

The O
music B
does O
get O
a O
little O
loud O
at O
times O
but O
it O
just O
made O
me O
want O
to O
lean O
closer O
to O
my O
beautiful O
wife O
and O
as O
I O
did O
I O
got O
a O
whiff O
of O
corriander B

black B
white I
shakes I
came O
out O
good O
also O

It's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B
in O
NYC O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner B

The O
seating B
was O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O
people O
into O
the O
restaurant O
so O
be O
nice O
to O
your O
neighbor O
when O
you O
dine O
here O

I O
ordered O
the O
chu B
chu B
curry I
and I
my O
friend O
ordered O
the O
pad B
thai I
chicken I

We O
go O
on O
Mondays O
for O
the O
prix B
fixe I
and O
our O
experience O
with O
the O
food B
has O
been O
comparable O
to O
Blue O
Ribbon O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
my O
second O
favorite O
neighborhood O
Thai O
place O
the O
first O
being O
Joya O

However O
they've O
got O
the O
most O
amazing O
pastrami B
and O
the O
soups B
hit O
the O
spot O

Great O
bagels B
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
inexpensive O
sushi B

my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
an O
everything O
bagel B
with I
lox I
spread I
but O
all O
the O
bagles B
are O
unbeliavably O
good O

I O
wouldn't O
even O
have O
complained O
at O
all O
if O
the O
food B
at O
least O
tasted O
good O
but O
the O
quality B
of I
food B
was O
crappy O
too O

For O
the O
next O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
we O
stood O
in O
the O
crowded O
lobby B
area I
of O
this O
touristy O
restaurant O
listening O
to O
all O
types O
of O
explanations O
of O
why O
we O
were O
not O
being O
seated B

The O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O

Also O
good O
for O
client O
lunch B
meetings I
esp O

For O
$600 O
 the O
most O
we O
have O
ever O
paid O
not O
even O
waving O
a O
magic O
wand O
will O
ever O
get O
us O
back O
for O
a O
repeat O
performance O

The O
decor B
is O
dark O
cool O
and O
soothing O
while O
the O
food's B
presentation I
is O
spectacular O
considering O
the O
low O
prices B

The O
Waitstaff B
were O
very O
nice O
and O
suggested O
swordfish B
for O
my O
husband O
he O
enjoyed O
his O
meal B

The O
setting B
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O

Terrible O
terrible O
management B
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down O

Great O
friendly O
service B
Fast O
seating B
Fast O
Delivery B
Excellent O
sushi B

The O
desserts B
are O
more O
appealing O
then O
stuffy O
overpriced O
French O
restaurants O

The O
Italian B
food I
has O
flavor O
that O
can O
be O
sort O
of O
surprising O
on O
the O
UES O
and O
the O
service B
turns O
from O
a O
nightmare O
to O
attentivethey O
sort O
of O
remind O
me O
of O
the O
NY O
Yankees O
of O
the O
late O
90's O
no O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
look O
you O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
rally O
just O
around O
the O
corner O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O

I O
found O
the O
food B
to O
be O
outstanding O
particulary O
the O
salmon B
dish I
I O
had O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O

The O
New O
York O
Times O
has O
reviewed O
this O
place O
three O
times O
already O
you O
know O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
good O

Baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food B
and O
a O
nice O
decor B
at O
reasonable O
prices B

Emilio O
the O
owner B
is O
often O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
table O
greeting O
guests O
as O
they O
come O
and O
go O

I O
have O
been O
to O
spice O
three O
times- O
twice O
during O
lunch B
and O
once O
at O
dinner B

Moules B
were O
excellent O
lobster B
ravioli I
was O
VERY O
salty O

I O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
expecting O
to O
be O
surprised O
but O
left O
bored O
and O
overcharged O

A O
cheap O
eat B
for O
NYC O
but O
not O
for O
dosa B

The O
atmosphere B
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O

The O
seafood B
is O
amazing O
there's O
a O
good O
wine B
list I
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O

i O
don't O
usually O
order O
wine B
with O
indian B
so O
i O
can't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine B
list O
or O
their O
wines B

Pastrami B
or I
corned I
beef I
are O
juicy O
and O
piled O
high O
ask O
for O
extra O
rye B
bread I

$200 O
for O
2 O
glasses B
of I
champagne I
not O
too O
expensive O
bottle B
of I
wine I
and O
2 O
after B
dinner I
drinks I

Really O
though O
where's O
the O
seasoning B

The O
food B
was O
just O
OK O
at O
least O
for O
what O
food B
was O
available O

by O
dinner O
time O
they O
turn O
it O
around O
and O
mount O
a O
huge O
comeback O

The O
waitress B
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B
is O
phenomenal O

The O
ambience B
was O
nice O
but O
service B
wasn't O
so O
great O

Solid O
wine B
list I
knowledgeable O
staff B
friendly O
owners B
and O
an O
adventurous O
ever-changing O
menu B
keep O
us O
coming O
back O

The O
people B
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O

We O
didn't O
even O
see O
a O
menu B
as O
our O
waiter B
described O
both O
the O
specials B
and O
the O
main B
dishes I

The O
location B
and O
ambience B
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O

otherwise O
good O
stuff B
for O
late O
nite O
eats B

The O
dinner B
was O
ok O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O

Its O
not O
the O
same O
if O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
inside O

I O
love O
and O
I O
know O
gourmet B
food I
by O
excellence O

I O
plan O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
trying O
their O
assortment O
of O
bruschetta B
panini's O

Great O
people O
watching O
as O
others O
do O
the O
same O
to O
you O

Maybe O
it O
was O
just O
an O
unintentional O
mistake O
but O
I've O
experienced O
the O
same O
with O
other O
restaurants O
so O
I O
don't O
appreciate O
such O
practice O

Two O
people O
in O
our O
party O
felt O
like O
something O
else O
and O
Volare O
immediately O
obliged O
with O
two O
great O
dishes B
that O
were O
not O
in O
their O
regular O
menu B

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B
and O
has O
no O
personality O

The O
waitress B
remembers O
me O
and O
is O
very O
friendly O
she O
knows O
what O
my O
regular O
is O
and O
that's O
the O
fried B
mini I
buns I
with I
the I
condensed I
milk I
and I
the I
assorted I
fruits I
on I
beancurd I

I'm O
going O
back O

Diner O
food B
at O
bistro O
prices B
is O
a O
bummer O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
been O
going O
here O
regularly O
for O
two O
years O

wow O
how O
have O
i O
missed O
this O
one O
tried O
Long O
Tan O
last O
week O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
now O
know O
what O
the O
NY O
TIMES O
and O
many O
more O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
already O
knew O

Go O
there O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
leave O
feeling O
like O
a O
baby O
Veal O
Calfok O
bad O
joke O
but O
you O
will O
see O

While O
we O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
the O
food B
it O
was O
annoying O
to O
scream O
across O
the O
table O
for O
conversation O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B
was O
outstanding O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O

The O
portions B
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter B

delicious O
bagels B
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O

Ive O
passed O
by O
the O
spot O
tons O
of O
times O
always O
wanting O
to O
go O
in O

All O
the O
food B
was O
hot O
tasty O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O

This O
is O
one O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
pizza B
more O
out O
but O
not O
a O
good O
place O
for O
take-out B
pizza B

Our O
server B
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O

Try O
green B
curry I
with I
vegetables I

Would O
recommend O
this O
place O
as O
a O
good O
date O
spot O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
drop O
a O
ton O
of O
cash O

While O
I'm O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
happens O
all O
the O
time-this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
treatment O
that O
buys O
repeat O
business O

This O
place O
was O
not O
ALL O
THAT O

First O
of O
all O
this O
place B
is O
*not* O
romantic O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch's O
editorial O
review O

The O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy O
vault O
like O
door B
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced B
too O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
drive O
to O
Corona O

The O
food B
was O
not O
very O
tasty O
the O
portioins B
were O
tiny O
even O
for O
such O
a O
high O
quality O
restaurant O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O

Others O
have O
to O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants O
and O
feel O
sad O
until O
they're O
eaten O

Why O
make O
a O
reservation B
if O
you O
aren't O
going O
to O
keep O
it O

The O
Pad B
Thai I
is O
excellent O
here O
as O
well O

Big O
and O
gawky O
on O
the O
outside O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Mary's O
many O
times O
and O
I O
like O
it O

Searching O
to O
get O
out O
from O
the O
cold O
freezing O
weather O
we O
went O
into O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
a O
deli O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
lunch B
specials I
just O
because O
it O
tasts O
the O
same O
with O
other O
regular O
chinese O
restaurant O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O

This O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
in O
Soho O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
had O
a O
pleasant O
experience O

We O
parked O
on O
the O
block O
of O
Nina's O
the O
place B
looked O
nice O
with O
people O
obviously O
enjoying O
their O
pizzas B

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O

For O
$760 O
for O
2 O
people O
it's O
a O
once O
in O
a O
lifetime O
experience O

The O
food B
is O
ok O
but O
not O
any O
better O
than O
what O
you O
get O
at O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
restaurant O

We O
had O
the O
pot-stickers B
which O
were O
great O
and O
a O
tempura B
dish I
that O
was O
great O

I O
think O
the O
stuff B
was O
better O
than O
Disney O

After O
reading O
the O
good O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
with O
two O
friends O

While O
the O
$20 O
entree B
range I
is O
not O
overly O
expensive O
in O
New O
York O
City O
there O
is O
definitely O
better O
food B
in O
that O
range O
and O
so O
Sapphire O
despite O
it's O
lovely O
atmosphere B
will O
most O
likely O
not O
be O
a O
restaurant O
to O
which O
I O
will O
return O

Orsay O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
authentic O
French B
food I
in O
NYC O

I O
had O
been O
searching O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
restaurant O
in O
New O
York O
where O
I O
could O
really O
feel O
unwanted O
and O
ignored O
and O
I O
finally O
found O
it O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O

Well O
their O
deliveries B
take O
for O
ever O
and O
the O
food B
is O
usually O
cold O

The O
staff B
is O
no O
nonsense O

Chinese O
Desserts O
are O
known O
for O
healthful O
benefits O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
sweetness O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O

And O
really O
large O
portions B

The O
place O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O

This O
is O
a O
great O
Thai O
restaurant O
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff B

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger O
House O
several O
times O
and O
it's O
always O
good O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B
salmon I
and I
roe I
appetizer I
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch B
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B

I O
recommend O
the O
garlic B
shrimp I
okra B
bindi I
and O
anything O
with O
lamb B

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
I've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place O

To O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
good O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
to O
Ping's O
three O
weekends O
in O
a O
row O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter B
we're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O

The O
menu B
was O
impressive O
with O
selections O
ranging O
from O
a O
burger B
to O
steak B
to O
escargot B

In O
fact O
two O
people O
could O
really O
share O
one O
plate B

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
authentic O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O

during O
happy O
hour O

Good O
for O
casual B
dinner I
with O
jeans O
and O
sneakers O

Love O
YUKA O

Anyway O
the O
food B
is O
good O
the O
price B
is O
right O
and O
they O
have O
a O
decent O
wine B
list I

Go O
go O
hurry O
before O
everyone O
finds O
out O
about O
it O

Prices B
are O
higher O
to O
dine O
in O
and O
their O
chicken B
tikka I
marsala I
is O
quite O
good O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O

This O
place O
has O
many O
different O
styles B
of I
pizza I
and O
they O
are O
all O
amazing O

The O
photos O
of O
the O
restaurant O
in O
its O
web O
site O
are O
way O
better O
than O
the O
real O
look B

The O
food B
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B
tiny O

But O
the O
coconut B
rice I
was O
good O

It O
took O
them O
25 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
our O
appetizer B

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
this O
neighborhood O
spot O
for O
years O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O

The O
food B
was O
great O

Pair O
you O
food B
with O
the O
excellent O
beers B
on I
tap I
or O
their O
well O
priced B
wine B
list I

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B
minimun I
then O
you'll O
love O
it O
here O

All O
of O
my O
co-workers O
stated O
that O
the O
food B
was O
amazing O
and O
wondered O
why O
they O
hadn't O
heard O
about O
this O
place O

Anyway O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
cross O
the O
williamsburg O

Metrazur O
has O
a O
beautiful O
spot B
overlooking O
the O
main O
terminal O

Friendly O
staff B
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal B
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with O

When O
I'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St O
Bart's O

Guess O
the O
555Soul O
ads O
didn't O
launch O
her O
big O
modeling O
career O

The O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
small O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
get O
a O
table B
quickly O

Besides O
we O
were O
on O
vacation O

I O
love O
this O
cozy O
around O
the O
way O
Rest O

Quality B
of I
food I
is O
excellent O
and O
price B
is O
cheap O
stick O
to O
pork B
fish B
chicken B
lamb B
and O
vegetables B

Don't O
leave O
without O
trying O
One O
Night O
in O
Tokyo O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O

This O
is O
my O
favorite O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O

The O
place B
is O
a O
little O
tight O
and O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
the O
seating B
by O
the O
entranceway O
can O
be O
pretty O
drafty O

The O
appetizing B
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O

But O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun B

The O
food B
is O
fresh O
delicious O
and O
reasonably O
priced B

Raga O
stands O
out O
with O
an O
interesting O
fusion B
of I
French I
and I
Indian I
cooking I

A O
few O
tips: O
skip O
the O
turnip B
cake I
roast B
pork I
buns I
and O
egg B
custards I

The O
bagels B
are O
fabulous O

Oh O
yes O
and O
they O
lie O
on O
the O
phone O
claiming O
they O
have O
seating B
in I
the I
garden I
then O
of O
course O
the O
seats B
are O
not O
available O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water B
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B
to O
eat O

The O
food B
was O
very O
good O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
the O
place B
its O
self O
was O
great O

The O
food B
options I
rule O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost B
and O
a O
great O
deal O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
where O
greasy O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O

We O
ate O
here O
in O
March O
2006 O
and O
ordered O
the O
pre-theatre B
3-course I
dinner I
with O
wine B
flight I

Definately O
check O
it O
out O

Probably O
much O
busier O
for O
lunch B
it's O
seldom O
crowded O
for O
dinner B
too O
close O
to O
downtown O

Their O
calzones B
are O
horrific O
bad O
vomit-inducing O
YUCK O

It O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
a O
drink B
and O
they O
almost O
always O
forget O
to O
bring O
something O
although O
they O
dont O
forget O
to O
charge O
you O
for O
it O

The O
place B
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B
scene I
seems O
to O
be O
happening O

Saturday O
Nov O
6th O
I O
had O
a O
group O
from O
work O
come O
in O
with O
about O
35 O
people O
and O
the O
staff B
was O
amazing O
to O
accomodate O
us O

Good O
spreads B
great O
beverage B
selections I
and O
bagels B
really O
tasty O

First O
the O
waiter B
who O
served B
us O
neglected O
to O
fill O
us O
in O
on O
the O
specials B
which O
I O
would O
have O
chosen O
had O
I O
known O
about O
them O

We O
will O
be O
back O

Also O
top O
the O
meal B
with O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfect O
slice O
of O
tiramisu B

It O
seems O
like O
this O
is O
a O
place O
the O
locals O
like O
and O
the O
people O
working O
here O
liked O
it O
too O

Check O
out O
the O
secret B
back I
room I

It's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel's O
Share O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
more O
romantic O
bar B

Authentic O
food B
and O
they O
have O
REAL O
service B
not O
just O
the O
rush O
you O
get O
sometimes O
when O
they O
try O
to O
push O
you O
out O
the O
door O

Stick O
to O
the O
gulab B
jamun I

I O
am O
amazed O
by O
the O
poor O
reviews- O
I O
find O
this O
place O
to O
be O
standout O
Italian O
in O
an O
area O
flooded O
with O
Italian- O
great O
prices B
great O
atmosphere B
good O
service B
and O
a O
wonderful O
wine B
list I

I O
was O
back-to-back O
with O
the O
diner B
at O
the O
table B
behind O
me O
and O
wait B
staff I
had O
to O
hoist O
trays O
over O
our O
heads O
as O
they O
squeezed O
past O
us O
again O
and O
again O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B

I O
was O
a O
little O
leary O
about O
Mary's O
at O
first O
- O
it's O
small O
crowded O
and O
you O
usually O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
- O
but O
I'm O
glad O
I O
finally O
tried O
it O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O

We've O
only O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
once O
but O
we O
have O
ordered O
many O
times O
for O
dinner B

I O
got O
enough O
reasons O
to O
keep O
coming O
back O

By O
far O
this O
is O
the O
only O
chinese O
desserts B
place I
I I
know I
in O
NY O
or O
anywhere O
close O
in O
the O
Northeastern O
America O
that O
serves O
desserts B
with I
frog I
jelly I
in O
a O
couple O
of O
varieties O
and O
pig B
feet I
ginger I
simmered I
in I
black I
vinegar I

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced B

The O
characters O
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B
cuisine I

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host B
Vittorio O
and O
his O
crew B
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family--although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not-so-little O
gem O
does O
it O
amazing O
he's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not-so-frequent O
visitor O

The O
restuarant O
itself O
is O
not O
large O
but O
seems O
to O
have O
several O
round B
tables I
to O
accomodate O
large O
groups O
hoping O
to O
save O
a O
buck O
to O
eat O
authentic O
Taiwanese B

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
the O
portion B
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B
fries I
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O

It O
is O
the O
type O
of O
place O
to O
run O
into O
old O
friends O
and O
have O
a O
late O
raucus O
dinner B

The O
food B
is O
delicious O
- O
from O
the O
specials B
to O
the O
regular B
menu-fare I
the O
dishes B
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O

Prices B
are O
in O
line O

The O
combination O
of O
fresh B
tomato I
sauce I
fresh B
mozz I
cheese I
basil B
and O
the O
dough B
they O
make O
with O
imported O
flour B
makes O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
pizza's O
in O
NY O

The O
food B
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O

and O
for O
this O
i O
had O
to O
shell O
out O
a O
small O
fortune O

For O
all O
of O
you O
new O
to O
Indian B
food I
try O
the O
Paneer B
Roll I
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
heaven O

The O
food B
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates B

Both O
the O
fresh B
mozzerella I
slices I
and O
the O
Plain B
Cheese I
slice I
are O
phenomenal O

I O
have O
tried O
literally O
every O
restaurant O
on O
curry O
row O

The O
food B
is O
terrible O
and O
overall O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
monster O
sushi O
twice O
the O
46th O
st O
once O
the O
23rd O
st O
one O
a O
number O
of O
times O

Unfortunately O
the O
food B
was O
NOT O
something O
to O
get O
worked O
up O
about O

It's O
constantly O
open O
catering O
to O
the O
Pakistani O
cabbies O
lined O
up O
on O
Crosby O
St O
so O
there's O
more O
turnover O
with O
the O
food B
than O
you'd O
expect O
ie O
surprisingly O
fresh O

I O
had O
Filet B
Mignon I
with I
garlic I
mash I

I O
went O
at O
6:00 O
PM O
specifically O
for O
the O
pre-theater B
menu I
$1995 O
for O
roasted B
tomato I
soup I
with I
chevre I
steak B
frites I
creme B
brulee I
and O
it O
was O
marvelous O

The O
waitstaff B
were O
attentive O
polite O
and O
helpful O
- O
an O
impressive O
feat O
in O
such O
close O
quarters O

Go O
inside O
and O
you O
won't O
want O
to O
leave O

I O
loving O
bringing O
friends O
here O
- O
and O
I O
do O
so O
every O
chance O
I O
get O

- O
the O
bread B
at O
the O
beginning O
is O
super O
tasty O
and O
makes O
you O
want O
more O
- O
the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
personal O
sizes O
however O
be O
warned O
that O
the O
Peter's B
Favourite I
pizza B
with O
prosciutto O
and O
baby O
arugula O
is O
actually O
a O
margarite B
pizza B
with O
cold O
prosciutto O
and O
baby O
arugula O
on O
top O
like O
a O
salad B

Yes O
the O
prices B
are O
high O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B
paninis B
tramezzinis B
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O

Have O
always O
found O
that O
the O
waiters B
will O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
helpful O
despite O
the O
fact O
they O
are O
often O
busy O
with O
lots O
of O
diners B

While O
this O
isn't O
classical O
restaurant O
fare O
the O
chef B
has O
given O
new O
life O
to O
an O
old O
cuisine B
with O
some O
really O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
dishes B
that O
are O
genuinely O
Indian B
without O
being O
heavy O
or O
same O
old O
restaurant O
burn-outs O

The O
owner B
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O

He O
takes O
real O
pride O
in O
his O
food B
and O
his O
business O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant O
Saul O
on O
Smith O
Street O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
nice O
enjoyable O
meal B
at O
Montparnasse O
go O
early O
for O
the O
pre-theater B
prix-fixe I

Over O
the O
years O
it O
has O
always O
provided O
a O
pleasurable O
dining B
experience O
with O
quality O
food B
and O
wine B

I O
would O
go O
back O
tho O

The O
photobook O
menu B
was O
a O
cute O
touch O
certainly O
helped O
my O
group O
and O
I O
pick O
the O
fried B
chicken I
pork B
chop I
and O
noodle B
dishes I
that O
we O
all O
ordered O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B
food I
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O

Great O
romantic O
place B
for O
a O
date O
try O
to O
get O
the O
corner B
booth I
table I
for O
a O
little O
privacy B
and O
to O
sit O
close O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open B
faced I
cheese I
sandwich I
and O
the O
manager B
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O

If O
you O
don't O
mind O
all O
that O
noise O
then O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O

We O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O
home O
with O
us O

Get O
there O
before O
7pm O

very O
good O
breads B
as O
well O

if O
this O
happens O
just O
ask O
for O
real O
naan B

We O
were O
fans O
of O
the O
half-price B
Saturday I
night I
option I
until O
some O
inedible O
squid B
during O
a O
recent O
visit O

So O
if O
yo O
really O
don't O
care O
who O
is O
sittingnext O
to O
you O
which O
is O
about O
2 O
inches O
away O
I O
would O
say O
try O
it O

Pizza B
is O
terrific O
as O
is O
homemade B
pasta I

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value B
ofr I
money I

My O
first O
encounter O
happened O
one O
friday O
evening O
with O
a O
friend O

Example O
is O
the O
soup B
which O
was O
about O
6 O
oz O
for O
$12 O
dollars O
and O
the O
mushrooms B
where O
$12 O
for O
about O
1oz O

Service B
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting B

From O
beginning B
appetizers I
the O
scallops B
were O
incredible O
to O
the O
delicious O
chocolate B
souffle I
with I
rasberry I
mint I
sorbet I
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O

My O
goodness O
everything O
from O
the O
fish B
to O
the O
rice B
to O
the O
seaweed B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

This O
place O
started O
off O
a O
little O
iffy O
but O
is O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
I'm O
indian O
so O
I O

do O
a O
great O
job O
for O
restaurant O
week O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O

The O
dishes B
offered O
were O
unique O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B
sausages I
sardines B
with I
biscuits I
large B
whole I
shrimp I
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B
ice I
cream I
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I've O
ever O
had O

This O
is O
where O
the O
aforementioned O
line O
was O

The O
food B
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price B
is O
moderate O

Aside O
from O
the O
bearded O
courdoroy O
blazer O
professor O
type O
with O
the O
NYU O
student O
he's O
sleeping O
with O
that O
week O
you O
see O
a O
strange O
mix O
of O
hipsters O
frat O
boys O
Will O
Smith O
types O
who O
need O
to O
be O
told O
they O
are O
black O
bitter O
cougars O
who O
cant O
understand O
why O
they O
arent O
married O
yet O

While O
the O
ambiance B
and O
atmosphere B
were O
great O
the O
food B
and O
service B
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O

We O
always O
go O
there O
on O
the O
weekends O
and O
leave O
extremely O
full O
and O
satisfied O

i O
dont O
how O
this O
place O
is O
still O
running O

The O
server B
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served B
us O
our O
food B
and O
drinks B
with O
a O
smile O

We O
were O
in O
search O
of O
food B
and O
stumbled O
on O
this O
block O
of O
Indian O
restaurants O
on O
East O
Sixth O
Street O

Planet O
Thailand O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
 I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B
which O
is O
great O
 the O
thai B
food I
is O
excellent O
too O
 
Very O
excited O
to O
hear O
that O
short-term O
Chef B
Jason O
Narone O
has O
moved O
on O
he O
truly O
was O
a O
low O
point O
of O
their O
Sterling O
track O
record O

Excellent O
experience O

Well O
worth O
the O
trip O
close O
to O
City O
Hall O
and O
downtown O
subway O
stops O

I O
had O
to O
share O
my O
table B
with O
a O
loud O
group O
of O
kids O
and O
the O
service B
was O
rude O
an O
unattentive O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
and O
eat O

All O
in O
all O
I O
don't O
see O
how O
you O
can O
go O
wrong O

The O
sauce B
on I
the I
pizza I
is O
sooo O
good O
with O
garlic B
and O
fresh B
tomatoes I
and O
they O
don't O
skimp O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
they O
have O
outdoor B
seating I
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O

My O
husband O
had O
the O
mesclun B
salmon B
and O
ice B
cream I
and O
he O
enjoyed O
all O
3 O
courses B

We O
were O
told O
that O
the O
wait B
was O
about O
twenty O
minutes O
and O
there O
would O
be O
no O
problem O
for O
our O
8:00 O
pm O
curtain O
call O

The O
food B
is O
usually O
good O
but O
it O
certainly O
isn't O
a O
relaxing O
place B
to O
go O

I'm O
told O
that O
it O
is O
open O
24hrs O
which O
is O
good O

Super O
friendly O
and O
knowledgable O
staff B
fabulous O
bistro B
fare I
and O
a O
wonderful O
jazz B
brunch I
with O
great O
live B
jazz B
the I
chilaquiles B
were O
awesome O

The O
prices B
were O
fantastic O

What O
a O
great O
place O

Still O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill B
were O
off-set O
by O
the O
pour-your-own O
measures B
of I
liquers I
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O

The O
table B
service B
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
more O
attentive O
but O
as O
someone O
who O
also O
works O
in O
the O
service B
industry O
I O
understood O
they O
were O
busy O

It's O
not O
mind-blowing O
but O
to O
me O
thai B
food I
never O
is O
and O
never O
will O
be O

Food B
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B
belly I
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
so O
that O
fat B
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt-in-your-mouth O
experience O

Although O
one O
night O
we O
went O
it O
was O
super O
cheesy O
and O
another O
night O
it O
was O
less O
cheesy O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
a O
little O
loud O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
yell O
at O
each O
other O
to O
talk O

i've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B
was O
fine O
if O
not O
good O

It O
is O
kinda O
nosiy O
and O
the O
tables B
are O
close O
together O
but O
it's O
still O
a O
beautiful O
place B
to O
enjoy O
a O
nice O
dinner B

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
pizza B
tastes O
so O
good O
and O
is O
so O
cheap O

Nicky O
the O
Nose O
at O
the O
bar B
is O
a O
treat O

I O
went O
to O
Ruby O
Foo's O
after O
work O
with O
a O
group O
of O
6 O

I'm O
amazed O
we O
haven't O
been O
kicked O
out O
of O
this O
place O
yet O

Service B
was O
prompt O
friendly O
and O
great O

I O
haven't O
eat O
a O
lamb B
chop I
as O
delicious O
as O
thatthe O
salads B
are O
really O
nice O
dressed O
with O
lemon B
and O
extra B
virgnin I
olive I
oil I

The O
sushi B
was O
awful O

Katz's O
has O
been O
a O
NYC O
original O
for O
over O
100 O
years O

You O
can O
get O
an O
excellent O
meal B
at O
most O
of O
the O
many O
Indian O
restaurants O
on O
nearby O
Lexington O
Avenue O
for O
the O
cost B
of O
one O
the O
dainty O
dishes B
here O

The O
Pastrami B
sandwich I
was O
like O
buttah O
and O
with O
pickles B
and O
an O
icy O
cold O
beer B
to O
wash O
it O
down O
it O
was O
a O
pleasurable O
experience O

The O
plain B

was O
soggy O
and O
the O

here O
there O

Everything O
at O
Sala O
Thai O
is O
tasty O
and O
well-portioned O

After O
all O
that O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip B

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
cheap O
lunch B
or O
dinner B

Behind O
this O
counter B
two O
men O
are O
squeezed O
in O

Great O
find O

If O
only O
they O

they'd O
make O
a O

Whenever O

a O
Sushi B
fix I
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O

and O
great O
service B

Our O
waitress B
was O
sweet O
and O
accomodating O
not O
overbearing O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table B
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation B
sigh I
on O
them O

I O
was O
really O
disappointed O
ant O
wanted O
to O
tell O
everyone O
not O
to O
go O
eat O
or O
even O
take O
out O
food B
from O
there O

The O
website O
and O
rating O
makes O
this O
place B
look O
wonderful O
but O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
very O
disappointing O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O

The O
outdoor B
atmosphere I
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O

A O
large O
is O
$20 O
and O
toppings B
are O
about O
$3 O
each O

In O
any O
event O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O

I O
definitely O
wouldn't O
go O
back O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
for O
that O
bucks O

brick O
oven O
gallery O
is O
My O
pick O
for O
best O

anywhere O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B
and O
great O
food B
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O

For O
many O
people O
this O
may O
not O
seem O
like O
Aunthentic O
Thai B
food I
because O
most O
places O
in O
NYC O
arent O
quite O
authentic O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels B

Oh O
don't O
even O
let O
me O
start O
with O
how O
expensive O
the O
bills B
were O

A O
hearty O
two O
thumbs O
up O

The O
scallion B
pancakes I
and O
fried B
dumplings I
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O

All O
the O
appetizers B
and O
salads B
were O
fabulous O
the O
steak B
was O
mouth O
watering O
and O
the O
pasta B
was O
delicious O

Besides O
having O
the O
table B
we O
had O
been O
promised O
given O
to O
other O
restaurant O
patrons O
twice O
before O
we O
were O
actually O
seated O
we O
were O
served B
dishes B
we O
hadn't O
ordered O
three O
times O
received O
one O
of O
our O
orders O
20 O
minutes O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
table B
had O
been O
served B
and O
that O
order O
was O
undercooked O
and O
charged O
$45 O
more O
than O
we O
should O
have O
been O
on O
our O
bill B

Service B
is O
top O
notch O

The O
food B
now O
is O
inconsistent O

All O
pretty O
good O

You O
can O
also O
special O
order O
any O
kind O
of O
dumplingetc O

you O
guys O
rock O

Chance O
is O
a O
joke O

I O
was O
pretty O
much O
full O
after O
our O
fondue B
appetizer I

BE O
CAREFUL O
before O
you O
request O
extra O
spice B

The O
octopus O
eaters O
were O
floored O
by O
the O
Octopus B
salad I

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG B
cooking I
in O
the O
foods B

I O
was O
at O
Rao's O
last O
Wed O

And O
the O
Tom B
Kha I
soup I
was O
pathetic O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B
beer I
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O

The O
decor B
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private B
boths I
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining B
hall I
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O

Service B
was O
quick O

Tends O
to O
turn O
people O
away O

We O
thought O
this O
a O
prelude O
to O
what O
the O
evening O
will O
be O
like O

I O
was O
turned O
on O
to O
this O
restaurant O
by O
a O
fellow O
foodie O
friend O
of O
mine O
and O
have O
been O
going O
back O
regularly O
ever O
since O

Drawbacks: O
service B
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don't O
toast O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office B
lunch I

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland O
Brewery O
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero O
Pomodori O

The O
sweet B
lassi I
was O
excellent O
as O
was O
the O
lamb B
chettinad I
and O
the O
garlic B
naan I
but O
the O
rasamalai B
was O
forgettable O

We've O
been O
following O
chef B
Lyle's O
food B
around O
New O
York O
for O
15 O
years O
and O
while O
remaining O
classic O
his O
innovations O
with O
bistro B
fare I
have O
made O
us O
return O
and O
return O

The O
best O
thing O
I O
tasted O
were O
the O
lambchops B

it's O
delicious O

The O
spicy B
tuna I
and O
salmon B
are O
the O
best O
we've O
ever O
had O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B
the O
prices B
are O
too O
high O

In O
addition O
the O
food B
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
reasonable O

Upon O
entering O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
owners B
Steven O
and O
Frederick O
who O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
more O
than O
gracious O
hosts B

If O
you O
live O
outside O
the O
neighborhood O
don't O
bother O

Been O
going O
here O
since O
it O
opened O
have O
seen O
the O
quality B
value I
decrease O
considerably O

Meat B
dishes I
now O
adorn O
the O
selections O
although O
there's O
still O
a O
large O
number O
of O
vegetarian-friendly B
choices I

I O
never O
had O
anything O
I O
didn't O
like O
here O

Reasonable O
prices B

they O
bring O
service B
up O
a O
notch O
by O
offerng O
complementary O
amuse B
bouche I
to O
all O
tables B
and O
gave O
us O
a O
small O
dessert B
for O
our O
celebration O

Try O
the O
crunchy B
tuna I
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O

It O
won't O
break O
the O
bank O
but O
I O
also O
wouldnt O
come O
back O
for O
the O
food B

All O
in O
all O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi B
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O

I've O
been O
to O
Joya O
twice O
and O
I O
will O
never O
go O
again O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live B
entertainment I
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special B
effects I

if O
you're O
looking O
for O
perfect O
traditional O
sushi B
go O
here O
- O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
interesting O
combinations O
try O

No O

on O

drinks I
though O

Wow O
over O
100 O
beers B
to O
choose O
from O

Be O
careful O
of O
portions B
- O
they're O
HUGE O

The O
Steak B
Tartare I
is O
a O
great O
bet O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O

My O
first O
time O
there O
I O
happened O
not O
to O
like O
the O
Crab B
Croquette I
apt I
that O
i O
ordered O
and O
they O
were O
happy O
to O
change O
it O
for O
me O
without O
making O
no O
big O
deal O

Great O
for O
large O
groups O
and O
celebrations O
- O
our O
SUPER O
HAPPY O
waiter B
was O
the O
entertainment O
of O
the O
evening O

Did O
I O
mention O
the O
wine B

Plus O
on O
Wednesday O
nights O
the O

It O

by O
far O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O

Now O
it's O
so O
crowded O
and O
loud O
you O
can't O
even O
talk O
to O
the O

couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O

I'm O
from O
England O
and O

never O
been O

Ciao O
Bella O

like O
saying O
her O
bread B
comes O
from O
a O
special O
bakery O
when O
we O

seen O
her O
buying O

The O
dim B
sum I
servings I
here O
are O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
I'm O
used O
to O

However O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2003 O
it O
seems O
the O
management B
has O
changed O
and O
the O
great O
big O
door B
has O
been O
replaced O
for O
a O
glass B
front I
ridding O
itself O
of O
the O
dark O
romantic O
getup O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B

It's O
a O
much O
more O
grown O
up O
restaurant O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
street O

Barbecued B
codfish I
was O
gorgeously O
moist O
- O
as O
if O
poached O
- O
yet O
the O
fabulous O
texture B
was O
let O
down O
by O
curiously O
bland O
seasoning B
- O
a O
spice B
rub I
might O
have O
overwhelmed O
however O
herb B
mix I
or O
other O
sauce B
would O
have O
done O
much O
to O
enhance O

We O
were O
treated O
with O
attitude O
ever O
since O
the O
moment O
we O
stepped O
into O
the O
restaurant O

After O
dinner B
take O
your O
date O
to O
the O
HUGE O
dance B
floor I
probably O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
you'll O
see O
in O
NY O

Taj O
Mahal O
offeres O
gret O
value B
and O
great O
food B

Has O
the O
chef B
and O
owner B
changed O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
recently O
had O
an O
early O
dinner B
at O
Artisanal O
and O
was O
satisfied O
with O
our O
experience O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place O

I O
wish O
I O
lived O
there O
as O
I O
would O
eat O
at O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
possible O

But O
don't O
ever O
order O
bacon B
late O
at O
nite O
either O
platter B
or O
in B
sandwiches I
for O
that O
matter O
don't O
from O
any O
take O
out O
place O
as O
it O
is O
from O
the O
morning O
frying B
turns O
out O
hard O
almost O
like O
bacos B
hurt O
my O
molars O

Outstanding O
Bagels B
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O

Pizza B
- O
the O
only O
pizza B
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings B
- O
the O
crust B
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
freshly O
baked O
bread B

If O
you're O
in O
town O
it's O
worth O
searching O
for O
another O
place O

I O
have O
tried O
the O
various O
slice O
joints O
around O
the O
village O
but O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
one O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
the O
perfect O
spot B
to O
warm O
up O

They O
even O
have O
a O
section O
in O
the O
menu B
called O
American B
Chinese I
food I

Service B
was O
warm O
and O
attentive O
beef B
carpaachio I
was O
exellent O
huge O
portion B
and O
pasta B
was O
fresh O
and O
well-prepared O

kalbi B
and O
nebbiolo B
do O
work O
together O

Best O
Italian B
food I
I O
ever O
had O
and O
being O
Italian B
that I
means O
alot O

I O
will O
recommend O
Scopa O
to O
all O
of O
my O
friends O
for O
a O
place O
to O
go O
for O
wonderful O
Italian B
food I

Located B
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O

This O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
time O
effort O
or O
money O
to O
say O
the O
least O

Looking O
around O
I O
saw O
a O
room B
full O
of O
New O

enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B
in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
not O
a O
clubhouse B
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
guys O

Hurley's O
is O
terrific O

They O
don't O
walk O
around O
with O
the O
trays B
of I
Dim I
Sum I

Took O
my O
sister O
here O
before O
attending O
a O
show O
one O
evening O

Great O
bar B
most O
gorgeous O
bartenders B
you've O
ever O
seen O
specifically O
the O
blond O
lady O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert B
but O
the O
waitress B
basically O
through O
the O
bill B
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O

Really O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff B
gives O
to O
the O
food B

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O

They O
came O
out O
over O
cooked O
and O
the O
cheese B
was O
almost O
non O
existant O

I O
had O
a O
terrific O
meal B
and O
our O
server B
guided O
us O
toward O
a O
very O
nice O
wine B
in O
our O
price B
range I
instead O
of O
allowing O
us O
to O
purchase O
a O
similarly O
priced B
wine B
that O
wasn't O
as O
good O

The O
svc B
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
must O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
Pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O

Never O
once O
did O
I O
leave O
feeling O
unwelcome O
or O
impressed O

The O
food B
is O
good O
especially O
their O
more O
basic O
dishes B
and O
the O
drinks B
are O
delicious O

But O
the O
main O
hit O
was O
the O
whole B
grilled I
fish I

I O
had O
the O
tuna B
tartare I
with O
sake B
mushroom B
ravioli I
with O
pinot B
noir I
and O
the O
chocolate B
sampler I
with O
a O
dessert B
wine I
for O
$49 O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch B

The O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
prepared O
along O
with O
the O
friendly O
and O
personable O
service B

I O
usually O
go O
there O
later O
at O
night O
when O
I O
get O
off O
work O
so O
I O
don't O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
crowds B
or O
lines B

Pizza B
here O
is O
consistently O
good O

We O
had O
a O
great O
tiem O
watching O
the O
shows B
and O
characters B
and O
ar O
food B
was O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O

After O
2 O
tries O
by O
the O
waiter B
to O
take O
it O
away O
we O
hadn't O
even O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
we O
had O
full O
beers B
yet O
to O
drink O
the O
manager B
approached O
and O
told O
us O
they O
needed O
the O
table O
for O
people O
with O
reservations B

Wouldn't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner B

Sauce B
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B
didn't O
have O
much O
flavor B

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoy O
Sangria B

But O
after O
last O
night O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I'm O
eating O
indian B
cuisine I

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B
dish I
and O
they O
were O
served B
timely O
and O
fresh O

First O
the O
wrong O
bread B
came O
out O
with O
the O
appetizer B
then O
when O
i O
tried O
to O
order O
a O
second O
glass B
of I
wine I
for O
my O
main B
course I

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
lonk O
dined O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B
and O
has O
great O
food B

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B
food I
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O

Tell O
them O
Herky O
sent O
you O
and O
get O
a O
free O
confused O
look O
from O
the O
waiter B

Make O
reservations B
but O
expect O
to O
be O
delayed O
15-20 O
minutes O
as O
the O
hosting B
staff I
was O
having O
difficulty O
seating B
guests O
who O
arrived O
with O
a O
reservation B
because O
they O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
walk O
ins O
being O
so O
close O
to O
Time O
Square O

The O
food B
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B

They O
don't O
seem O
to O
place O
an O
emphasis O
on O
specials B
or O
fresh O
ingredients B
which O
to O
me O
is O
necessary O
for O
good O
thai B

Other O
apetizers B
and O
food B

The O
noodle B
and I
rices I
dishes I
taste O
great O

The O
food's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O

The O
crust B
is O
thin O
the O
ingredients B
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
friendly O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel B
place O

the O
food B
was O
undercooked-the O
sauce B
watery O
and O
the O
vegetables B
raw O

And O
the O
fried B
clams I
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
to O
them O
to O
make O
'em O
worth O
eating O

The O
sauces B
used O
are O
also O
not O
that O
exciting O

The O
secret O
is O
the O
lunch B
menu I
which O
offers O
a O
complimentary O
appetizer B
with O
every O
entree B
ordered O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place O

The O
rice B
was O
poor O
quality B
and O
was O
cooked B
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O

We O
had O
champagne B
and O
caviar B
and O
felt O
like O
princesses O

The O
shrimp B
scampi I
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B
were O
plentiful O

I O
am O
surprised O
to O
say O
the O
least O
and O
find O
such O
practice O
not O
worth O
the O
effort O

When O
my O
dessert B
came O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O

I O
got O
the O
$10 O
10-piece O
dim B
sum I
combo I
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O

There O
are O
other O
Vietnamese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
chinatown O
area O
and O
you O
can O
forget O
about O
those O

There O
is O
also O
very O
limited O
seating B
and O
there O
can O
be O
a O
substantial O
wait B
in O
getting O
food B
at O
peak O
times O

If O
it's O
just O
a O
quick O
martini B
at O
the O
bar B
which O
I O
recommend O
Jeffery's O
or O
a O
mind O
blowing O
Roast B
Chicken I
go O
to O
Village O

No O
thanks O

There O
was O
a O
long O
wait B
for O
a O
table B
outside O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
sun O
anyway O
so O
our O
insde B
table B
was O
very O
nice O

I O
would O
definently O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O

The O
prices B
are O
wonderfully O
low O

If O
you O
like O
spicy B
food I
get O
the O
chicken B
vindaloo I

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE O

I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
their O
true O
strength O
lays O
in O
their O
amazingly O
delicious O
and O
cheap O
lunch B
specials I

So O
much O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
bar B
food I
go O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
menu B
while O
sampling O
one O
of O
their O
hand-crafted B
beers I

A O
big O
disappointment O
all O
around O

And O
its O
absolutely O
DELICIOUS O

No O
free O
drink B

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
can't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B
and O
service B
was O
excellent O

Definitely O
Highly O
NOT O
recommended O

While O
they O
keep O
the O
capex B
to O
a O
minimum O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O
bagels B
because O
they O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O

The O
two O
star O
chefs B
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O

Don't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B

They O
also O
have O
a O
back B
garden I
open O
in O
the O
summer O
- O
cute O
and O
French O
with O
outdoor B
seating I
- O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O

go O
to O
any O
corned O
indian O
restaurant O
and O
the O
little O
india O
strip O
along O
east O
6 O
st O
rules O
supreme O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B

Given O
the O
incredible O
architecture B
surrounding O
it O
this O
place B
has O
no O
character O

I'd O
call O
it O
an O
'italian O
dinner' O

my O
first O
time O
here O
was O
with O
my O
gf O
for O
our O
12 O
month O
anniversary O

While O
the O
place B
is O
not O
a O
hotspot O
hangout O
the O
drinks B
are O
unique O
and O
pack O
a O
lot O
of O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O

I O
have O
walked O
by O
this O
place O
for O
eons O
and O
finally O
went O
thanks O
to O
a O
girls' O
night O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B
remains O
excellent O

Their O
eggplant B
is O
so O
delicate O
sweet O
tender O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O

Each O
bite O
of O
food B
at O
Kai O
was O
indeed O
delicious O
fresh O
and O
elegant O

all O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
- O
considering O
the O
quality B
of I
food B
in O
most O
moderately O
priced B
restaurants O
is O
mediocre O
this O
was O
slightly O
more O
pricey O
and O
well O
worth O
it O

If O
you O
want O
to O
save O
some O
money O
don't O
go O
here O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B
pizza I
which O
tasted O
better O

I O
had O
the O
cod B
with I
paella I
spicy O
and O
very O
filling O
I'm O
a O
big O
eater O
and O
could O
only O
eat O
half O
while O
my O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
classic O
fish B
and I
chips I
again O
a O
big O
serving B
- O
at O
least O
5 O
pieces O
of O
fish B
and I
a I
basketful O
of O
fries B

It's O
a O
shame O
that O
a O
nice O
convenient O
place B
like O
the O
Pink O
Pony O
can O
be O
so O
ruined O
by O
lousy O
service B

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Citysearch O
did't O
call O
it O
right O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B

The O
porcini B
mushroom I
pasta I
special I
was O
tasteless O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B
tagliatelle I

Try O
the O
spicy B
wontons I
and O
the O
salt B
pepper I
shrimps I

THE O
FOOD B
PORTIONS I
ARE O
REALLY O
LARGE O

The O
fries B
are O
yummy O

Friendly O
and O
informative O
staff B
very O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
raw O
bar B
service I

Best O
Taiwanese B
food I
in O
NY O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
stop O
for O
great O
food B

All O
the O
pastas B
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
homemade B
lasagna I
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
that O
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
City O

What O
for O

Fantastic O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
i O
didn't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
for O
a O
first O
date O

We O
laughed O
when O
he O
finally O
offered O
us O
a O
dessert B
menu I
and O
we O
left O
a O
10 O
percent O
tip B
which O
was O
generous O
I O
feel O

And O
the O
prices B
were O
way O
to O
high O
for O
what O
you O
get O

But O
people O
from O
Sichuan O
will O
die O
for O
it O
 - O
Chongqing O
Hot O
Pot O
chongqing O
was O
the O
biggest O
city O
of O
Sichuan O
now O
became O

independent O
province O

Skip O
Baroanda O
down O
the O
street O
Eurotrashy O
snooty O
and O
expensive O
and O
check O
this O
place O
out O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O

The O
staff B
ignored O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
the O
entire O
time O
we O
were O
there O

Yet O
paired O
with O
such O
rude O
service B
would O
never O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
interested O
in O
carrying O
any O
kind O
of O
conversation O
while O
there O

I O
went O
to O
Areo O
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O

The O
in-house B
lady I
DJ I
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music B
and O
moreover O
takes O
requests O

I O
need O
at O
least O
three O
rolls B
to O
be O
full O
and O
that's O
at O
least O
$1400 O

Anyone O
who O
ever O
dined O
at O
a O
thai O
restaurant O
is O
in O
for O
a O
huge O
disappointment O

All O
of O
it O
was O
simply O
amazing O
unique O
and O
tasty O
and O
best O
of O
all O
it O
didn't O
break O
the O
bank O

Great O
wine B
list I
reasonably O
priced--Sara O

The O
hot B
dogs I
were O
cold O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
the O
buns B
were O
stale O

While O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
it O
wasn't O
cheap O
though O
not O
extremely O
expensive O
either O

Beef B
noodle I
soup I
is O
good O
as O
well O

I O
was O
so O
sad O
to O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
this O
place O
got O

Delivery B
service I
is O
great O
too O

The O
food's O
dazzling O
flavors B
overwhelm O
the O
palate O
truly O
embracing O
the O
beauty O
of O
authentic O
Thai B
cuisine I

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B
with O
a O
smile O

They O
pray O
to O
their O
Food O
Gods O
to O
make O
them O
into O
a O
good O
pizza B
like O
VT's O

The O
place B
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O

Molto O
bene O

the O
best O
I've O
found O
outside O
of O
the O
Chinatown O
masters O

They O
are O
amazing O

Avoid O
this O
place O

The O
food B
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
-- O
the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
herbs B
and O
tomatoes B

A O
must O
try O

As O
much O
as O
I O
like O
the O
food B
there O
I O
can't O
bring O
myself O
to O
go O
back O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded B
cheese I
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O

The O
prices B
and O
ambience B
are O
especially O
great O
considering O
it's O
in O
the O
West O
Village O

The O
soup B
is O
pretty O
good O
too O

It O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
reservation B
at O
a O
top O
place O
in O
NYC O
with O
a O
week's O
notice O

I O
have O
never O
better O
enjoyed O
humble O
root B
vegetables I
or O
a O
mushroom B
consomme I
- O
and O
this O
chef B
accomplishes O
without O
fats O

If O
you O
go O
to O
Roth's O
try O
to O
be O
served B
by O
Mike O
he O
is O
GREAT O

Based O
on O
a O
visit O
a O
month O
ago O
I O
returned O
the O
week O
before O
Christmas O
and O
was O
hugely O
disappointed O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O

not O
the O
food B
not O
the O
ambiance B
 not O
the O
service B
I O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviews O
you O
wait B
and I
wait B
 the O
wait B
staff I
are O
very O
rude O
and O
when O
you O
get O
in O
they O
are O
looking O
to O
get O
you O
right O
out O
 
I O
love O
Ess-a-bagel O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray's O
for O
convenience O

I O
always O
get O
the O
Shabu-Shabu B
dinner I
and O
the O
beef B
is O
always O
fresh O

The O
pizza B
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted O

We O
were O
very O
surprised O
by O
how O
good O
the O
food B
was O
on O
our O
first O
visit O
here O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O

Nha O
Trang O
while O
being O
notorious O
for O
utter O
lack O
of O
comfort B
and O
decor B
horribly O
slow O
wait B
staff I
and O
horribly O
quick O
meals B
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
vietnamese O
restaurants O
i've O
ever O
been O
to O
the O
pho B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
with O
very O
fresh O
vegtables B

On O
the O
other O
hand O
if O
you O
are O
not O
fooled O
easily O
you O
will O
find O
hundreds O
of O
restaurants O
that O
will O
give O
you O
service B
and O
ambiance B
that O
is O
on O
par O
with O
Alain O
Ducasse O
and O
food B
that O
will O
outshine O
in O
presentaion B
taste B
choice B
quality B
and O
quantity B

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
my O
friends O
meet O
me O
down O
here O
not O
only O
for O
the O
bar B
scene I
but O
also O
the O
promise O
of O
The O
Pizza O
Place O
at O
3am O

Is O
just O
the O
way O
it O
was O
in O
days O
gone O
by O

If O
I O
could O
rate O
the O
people B
this O
place O
would O
be O
off O
the O
charts O
- O
unfortunately O
- O
the O
pizza B
sorry O
- O
not O
the O
best O
in O
NYC O

The O
food B
is O
amazing O

Having O
not O
been O
home O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
may O
skew O
this O
reviewer O
a O
bit O
but O
the O
food B
was O
tasty O
and O
spicy O
sans O
the O
oil B
that O
comes O
floating O
along O
at O
similar O
venues O

The O
portions B
are O
now O
very O
small O
the O
sauces B
are O
overly-ambitious O
usually O
inedible O
while O
the O
service B
is O
still O
good O
the O
restaurant O
due O
to O
its O
popularity O
seems O
frantic O

For O
the O
price B
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O

The O
owner B
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
a O
great O
guy O
go O
try O
his O
pizza B
you'll O
like O
it O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
great O

It O
can O
be O
a O
very O
fun O
experience O
with O
a O
group O
and O
kids O
6 O
and O
over O
would O
love O
it O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
I O
don't O
need O
overpriced O
food B
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait-staff B
who O
don't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner B
clumsy O
service B
and O
management B
that O
doesn't O
care O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B
urchin I
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O

The O
service B
is O
a O
little O
scatty O
at O
times O
but O
all O
is O
forgiven O
when O
the O
food B
arrives O

The O
bruscetta B
is O
a O
bit O
soggy O
but O
the O
salads B
were O
fresh O
included O
a O
nice O
mix B
of I
greens I
not O
iceberg B
all O
dishes B
are O
served B
piping O
hot O
from O
the O
kitchen O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis O
is O
simply O
wonderful O

The O
atmosphere B
isn't O
the O
greatest O
 but O
I O
suppose O
that's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices B
down O
 
The O
pickles B
were O
great O
addition O

If O
your O
favorite O
Chinese B
food I
is O
General B
Tao I
chicken I
then O
this O
is O
NOT O
your O
place O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B
appetizers I

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B
the O
best O
around O
the O
service B
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O

Filled O
with O
suits O
though O
so O
you O
never O
really O
feel O
terribly O
comfortable O

The O
production O
is O
a O
symphony O
alot O
of O
fun O
to O
experienceThe O
food B
sublime O
for O
the O
most O
part O

Waiters B
tend O
to O
forget O
drinks B
completely O
food B
portions I
are O
so O
tiny O
two O
people O
have O
trouble O
sharing O
one O
entree B

my O
wife O
and O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
nyc O
for O
years O
and O
wouldn't O
miss O
roxys O
food B
is O
expensive O
but O
it's O
new O
york O

It's O
like O
you O
are O
transported O
to O
the O
Italian O
countryside O
very O
romantic O
and O
filled O
with O
antiques O

The O
cold B
appetizer I
dishes I
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O

Just O
go O
and O
see O
for O
yourself O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O

Interesting O
selection O
good O
wines B
service B
fine O
fun O
decor B

I O
hate O
this O

Any O
if O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B
you'll O
wait O
for O
max O
5 O
minutes O
- O
so O
have O
a O
drink B
at O
the O
bar B

Whether O
it's O
the O
parmesean B
porcini I
souffle I
or O
the O
lamb B
glazed I
with I
balsamic I
vinegar I
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
 sally O
 
The O
food B
at O
this O
place O
is O
'gourmet' B
Indian I
cuisine I

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese O
restaurant O

get O
over O
it O

But O
the O
thing O
that O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
hated O
was O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
and O
it O
felt O
like O
'bar' O
or O
'pub' O

However O
it O
just O
so O
happens O
that O
there's O
an O
even O
more O
amazing O
place O
just O
down O
the O
street O

While O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
corned B
beef I
sandwich I
Katz's O
has O
a O
charm O
about O
it O

However O
looking O
at O
the O
table O
next O
to O
ours O
we O
both O
sort O
of O
wished O
we O
had O
ordered O
pizza B
which O
looked O
PERRRRRRRRRFECT O

Priced B
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O

The O
fish B
was O
adequate O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O

I O
recommend O
ordering O
in O
on O
a O
weeknight O

If O
you O
live O
in O
new O
york O
city O
you'll O
find O
better O
food B
at O
small O
restaurants O
outside O
of O
time O
square O
and O
spend O
half O
the O
amount B

Try O
the O
olive B
cream I
cheese I
or O
the O
lox B
spread I
on O
a O
whole O
wheat O
everything O
bagel B

While O
it's O
not O
Nobu O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O

So O
my O
husband O
made O
up O
an O
excuse O
so O
we O
can O
leave O

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O

they O
didn't O
disappoint O
service B
from O
the O
second O
i O
arrived O
at O
the O
door O
was O
extremely O
pleasant O
and O
attentive O
with O
almost O
one O
server B
per O
table B

I O
don't O
know O
who O
they O
think O
they O
are O
but O
they O
have O
no O
respect O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
ever O
since O
they O
opened O
their O
cabaret O
next O
door O
and O
blasts O
loud O
music B
till O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
every O
weekend O
during O
the O
summer O

The O
rice B
to I
fish I
ration I
was O
also O
good--they O
didn't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice B

They O
used O
shredded B
cheese I
on O
top O

They O
are O
located O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Chinatown O

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B
of I
wines I
at O
reasonable O
prices B

Eating O
at O
Ottimo O
is O
like O
eating O
in O
Chef O
Salvatore O
Esposito's O
home O

Katz's O
deli O
is O
a O
great O
NY O
experience O

Check O
it O
out O

The O
only O
positive O
was O
the O
wait B
staff I
which O
was O
prompt O
knowledgable O
and O
likeable O

I O
couldn't O
reccommend O
their O
Godmother B
pizza I
any O
higher O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B
were O
great O

I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
this O
low-key O
upper O
eastsider O
and O
their O
authentically O
thai B
cuisine I

i O
would O
go O
again O
if O
i O
didn't O
have O
to O
pay O

For O
the O
location B
the O
prices B
are O
very O
reasonable O

The O
food B
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices B
here O
are O
mediocre O

My O
friend's O
food B
was O
also O
the O
complete O
opposite O
of O
what O
it's O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
aND O
look O
like O

I O
ordered O
the O
crab B
cocktail I
and O
it O
was O
soaked O
in O
a O
lime B
juice I
concoction I
where O
all O
you O
could O
taste O
was O
the O
lime B

I O
would O
like O
to O
return O
and O
try O
some O
of O
the O
other O
menu B
items I
when O
I O
don't O
have O
to O
rush O
off O
to O
a O
show O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B
wine B
and O
service B

Hopefully O
next O
time O
I O
will O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B

Alain O
Ducasse O
is O
the O
best O
of O
everything O
I O
mean O
everything O
was O
excelentI O

Not O
a O
typical O
pizza O
joint O
but O
good O
for O
a O
low O
key O
and O
fairly O
cheap O
nice O
sit O
down O
dinner B

The O
corned B
beef I
was O
tender O
and O
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O

GO O
HERE O

The O
best O
Chicken B
pad I

I've O
ever O
had O

We O
weren't O

at O
our O

more O
than O
an O
hour O

sushi B
cannot O
be O
beaten O

It O
has O
been O
my O
first O
choice O
ever O
since O
I O
discovered O
it O
 
Over O
100 O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own O

Haru O

very O
fresh O
fish B
has O
a O
trendy O
modern O
ambiance B
prime O
location B
on O
Park O
Avenue O
South O
and O
friendly O
service B

Warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B
seating I
in O
the O
warmer O
months O

Very O
romantic O
fires O
- O
I've O
literally O
spent O
hours O
at O
Lanterna O
drinking O
wine B
from O
their O
extensive O
wine B
and O
enjoying O
the O
ambience B

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake B
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O

I O
almost O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
bad O
review O
so O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
go O
here O
and O
I O
could O
have O
all O
the O
dumplings B
to O
myself O

After O
reading O
the O
posts O
I O
was O
always O
skeptical O
to O
go O
to O
The O
Minnow O
despite O
living O
in O
Park O
Slope O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
be O
back O
soon O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B
but O
never O
loud O

My O
turkey B
burger I
was O
not O
cooked O
at O
all O
my O
friends O
salmon B
was O
completely O
raw O

The O
service B
is O
spotty O
sometimes O
really O
friendly O
and O
sometimes O
barely O
there O

Decor B
is O
minimalist O
and O
clean O
- O
nothing O
to O
distract O
or O
commend O

His O
drinks B
are O
very O
inventive O
delicious O
and O
classy O

Great O
food B
great O
prices B
great O
service B

This O
isn't O
your O
corner O
Chinese B
food I
takeout O

Awsome O
Pizza B
especially O
the O
Margheritta B
slice O

This O
place B
however O
has O
a O
lot O
less O
pretension O
than O
Joya O
and O
the O
Thai B
food I
is O
still O
above-average O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
after O
reading O
reviews O
here O
as O
well O
as O
hobokenicom O

Try O
ordering O
from O
the O
regular O
menu B
then O
you O
would O
not O
regret O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table B
was O
reserved O

uni O
from O
maine O
vs O
california O
sea O
vs O
freshwater O
eel B
to O
get O
a O
good O
taste O
comparison O

We O
started O
with O
lox B
and O
mussels B
the O
best O
ive O
ever O
had O
ever O
and O
had O
the O
cod B
and O
trout B
for O
dinner B

The O
crispy B
chicken I
wasn't O
for O
us O
though O

JUST O
AWSOME O

Food B
is O
great O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O

I O
recommend O
the O
meatballs B
and O
caprese B
salad I
and O
the O
beans B
on I
toast I
were O
a O
wonderful O
start O
to O
the O
meal B

This O
place B
is O
incredibly O
tiny O

I O
will O
definetely O
go O
back O
again O
and O
again O
that's O
for O
sure O

I O
didn't O
complain O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B
so O
much O

This O
is O
one O
of O
our O
all-time O
favorite O

In O
reality O
to O
maximize O
potential O
diners B
they O
were O
still O
taking O
phone O
reservations B
and O
reallocating O
tables B
of O
those O
waiting B
in O
the O
lobby B

The O
wine B
is O
always O
good O
the O
tapas B
are O
always O
yummy O
especially O
with O
the O
warm O
pita B
bread I

But O
when O
you O
are O
seated O
the O
waitresses B
are O
great O
they O
explain O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B
and O
the O
price B
of O
the O
food B
is O
really O
cheap O
for O
the O
service B
you O
get O

this O
place O
is O
amazingly O
bad O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down O

I've O
been O
to O
several O
places O
for O
Dim B
Sum I
and O
this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
WORST O

I O
love O
this O
place O

The O
freshest O
best O
variety B
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B
and O
terrific O
food B

It's O
super-trendy O
and O
there's O
always O
someone O
to O
take O
that O
empty O
seat B
so O
it O
seems O
that O
customer O
service B
has O
been O
deemed O
not O
of O
the O
essence O

Dinner B
took O
almost O
4 O
hours O
without O
any O
lag O
time O

The O
people B
in O
the O
restaurant O
were O
pretty O
obnoxious O
and O
loud O

The O
sandwiches B
are O
dry O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O

The O
problem O
is O
just O
that-it O
is O
a O
sometimes O
kind O
of O
affair O

Price B
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O

The O
fried B
rice I
is O
really O
good O
too O

We O
were O
well O
attended O
to O
by O
the O
enthusiastic O
staff B
especially O
the O
manager B
Tony O
Gaskin O
who O
made O
excellent O
suggestions O
for O
our O
menu B
selections I

Made O
my O
dining B
experience I
uncomfortable O

It's O
a O
steal O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
based O
on O
prior O
internet O
comments O

still O
stay O
away O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
walked O
out O
after O
my O
table O
and O
aanother O
were O
serves B
eventhough O
they O
were O
there O
much O
longer O

I O
was O
with O
a O
party O
of O
7 O
close O
but O
not O
next O
the O
the O
front B
doors I
and O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
our O
coats O
on O

A O
very O
inviting O
restaurant O
with O
friendly O
service B

THe O
back B
garden I
sitting I
area I
is O
very O
pleasant O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal B
herb I
garden I

What's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O

Will O
go O
back O
but O
only O
sate O
those O
homesick O
stomach O
cravings O

Good O
French O
restaurant O
in O
an O
area O
devoid O
of O
decent O
restaurants O
unless O
you're O
into O
eating O
4 O
pound O
pastrami B
sandwiches I
at O
Katz' O
Deli O
or O
Mexican B
food I
which O
is O
supplied O
by O
capable O
restaurants O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant O

The O
drinks B
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B
selection I
is O
fairly O
priced B

We O
also O
had O
shared O
a O
house B
salad I
that O
was O
fresh O

The O
ceiling B
is O
amazing O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
in O
NYC O
celebrating O
our O
30th O
anniversary O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O

And O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
culinary O
nightmare O
the O
check B
was O
given O
to O
our O
table B
by O
knocking O
over O
a O
glass B
of I
water I

Not O
a O
small O
feat O
for O
good O
french B
food I
in O
the O
area O

The O
space B
is O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
live B
music I
so O
on O
 jazz B
nights I
it O
can O
be O
loud O
and O
cramped O

Food B
was O
average O
but O
tasty O

We O
come O
from O
New O
Jersey O
to O
eat O
at O
Kinoko O

Big O
Wong O
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment B

Will O
never O
be O
back O

The O
entree B
was O
bland O
and O
small O
dessert B
was O
not O
inspired O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O

Oh O
and O
it's O
too O
tiny O
for O
families O
with O
strollers O

The O
staff B
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B
salad I
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
the O
food B
here O
was O
decent O
not O
great O

The O
Pad B
thai B
lad B
nar I
and O
various O
other O
dishes B
all O
look O
good O
on O
paper O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
thai B
food I
in O
less O
asthetically O
pleasing O
places B

Delicious O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price B
but O
do O
not O
go O
here O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
and O
sit O
by O
the O
front B
door I

my O
picks: O
Guizhou B
chicken I
fish B
with I
hot I
bean I
source I
fish B
fillet I
in I
spicy I
source I
special B
menu I

Overall O
I'm O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
its O
Chinatown O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
but O
the O
open B
kitchen I
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O

Pizza B
was O
a O
little O
soggy O

The O
food B
inludes O
famous O
scrumptious O
bombay B
style I
chaat I
such O
as O
bhelpuri B
sevpuri B
and O
samosa B
chaats I
as O
well O
as O
other O
great O
indian B
appetizers I

The O
Singapore B
Mai I
Fun I
had O
NO O
curry B
flavor I
whatsoever O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O

Murray O
won't O
do O
it O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner B
location I

Definite O
go O
if O
you're O
used O
to O
good O
Indian B
restaurant I
food I
from O
abroad O

THR O
AT B
MOSHPHERE I
IS O
COMPACT O
MODERN O
YET O
COZY O

By O
far O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
Manhattan O

Decent O
Thai B
food I
in O
cute O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
dank O
- O
little O
Nolita O
hangout O
BUT O
service B
terrible O

Most O
people O
eat O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
typical O
Upper O
East O
Side O
snobs O
so O
be O
aware O

The O
waiter B
actually O
poured O
water B
on O
my O
hand O
and O
walked O
away O

The O
food B
is O
mostly O
made O
from O
scratch O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O

Worse O
of O
all O
$60 O
was O
erroneously O
added O
to O
our O
$80 O
bill B

Too O
cold O
to O
enjoy O

NO O
more O
reservations B
expensive O
tips B
and O
annoying O
stuff B

Try O
the O
sea B
bass I

$20 O
gets O
you O
unlimited O
sushi B
of O
a O
very O
high O
quality- O
I O
even O
took O
a O
friend O
here O
from O
Japan O
who O
said O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
sushi B
places O
in O
the O
US O
that O
he O
has O
been O
to O

I O
brought O
some O
buddies O
from O
CA O
and O
they O
loved O
it O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
but O
to O
be O
expected O

Sushi B
wasn't O
anything O
spectacular O
for O
the O
price B

During O
our O
meal B
the O
management B
came O
over O
and O
checked O
on O
us O
and O
even O
bought O
us O
a O
round B
of I
drinks I

But O
they O
don't O
have O
a O
toaster B
which O
is O
strange O

So O
for O
good O
food B
i'd O
recommend O
it O
but O
not O
for O
a O
fun O
night O
out O

The O
menu B
choices I
are O
similar O
but O
the O
taste B
lacked O
more O
flavor B
than O
it O
looked O

A O
must O
for O
all O
the O
Dosa B
lovers O

The O
portions B
are O
HUGE O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer B
and O
entree B
per O
person O
for O
two O
people O

The O
appetizers B
are O
just O
OK O
and O
the O
main B
courses I
were O
decidedly O
subpar O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O

The O
exotic B
food I
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O

The O
staff B
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
we O
can O
almost O
always O
get O
a O
table B

If O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
this O
really O
isn't O
a O
good O
place O
to O
go O

Try O
the O
mediterranean B
salad I
it O
is O
a O
true O
experience O
for O
your O
taste O
buds O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O

Of O
course O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O

I've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O

People B
are O
always O
friendly O

The O
cream B
cheeses I
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B

From O
the O
entrees B
to O
the O
sides B
to O
the O
drinks B
everything O
was O
creatively O
prepared O
yet O
still O
simple O

hmmm O

Service B
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O

It O
was O
not O
above O
ordinary O
and O
the O
beef B
version I
had O
cheap O
undercooked O
beef B

Chance O
is O
a O
small O
cozy O
restaurant O
with O
a O
romantic O
feel O
to O
it O
the O
decor B
is O
great O

It O
was O
nice O
and O
fresh O
but O
I O
can't O
give O
it O
high O
scores O
on O
being O
authentic O
thai B

Overall O
worht O
every O
penny O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O

Got O
club B
soda I
filled I
with I
ice I
no I
lime I

Only O
wine B
and O
beer B
are O
served B
but O
the O
house B
varities I
are O
actually O
quite O
good O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost B
the O
owners B
afortune O
to O
build O

My O
mouth O
starts O
to O
water O
merely O
thinking O
about O
the O
delight O
that O
is O
this O
restaurant O

I O
haven't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O

Oh O
and O
the O
complimentary O
pudding B
dessert I
was O
just O
enough- O
yummy O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O

we O
split O
a O
tasty O
vegetable B
samosa I
and O
the O
malai B
tikka I
wrap I

Knowledge O
of O
the O
chef B
and O
the O
waitress B
are O
below O
average O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks B

Decent O
wine B
selection I
too O

Go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
great O
time O

It O
saves O
walking O
in O
and O
waiting B
for O
a O
table B
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
crowded O
bar B
at O
dinnertime O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B
here O

It's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O

The O
place O
does O
get O
crowded O
so O
I O
recommend O
going O
between O
4-5 O
PM O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat B
cheese I
and O
panchetta B
raddichio B
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O

Disappointing O
food B
lousy O
service B

I'm O
from O
sichuan O
this O
is O
the O
restaurant O
I O
recommend O
going O

This O
lovely O
French-Asian O
fusion O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
amongst O
other O
great O
restaurants O
on O
Smith O
Street O

If O
you O
want O
a O
casual O
neighborhood O
bistro O
that O
has O
great O
food B
and O
excellent O
service B
this O
is O
the O
place O

great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
a O
drink B
too O
because O
they O
have O
100 O
kinds B
of I
beer I

But O
this O
place O
is O
a O
well-oiled O
machine O
so O
they O
know O
what O
they're O
doing O

Over O
price B
and O
small O
portions B
 
Meanwhile O
the O
bartender B
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne B
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O
bottle O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
an O
amuse O
of O
turnip B
soup I
with I
pureed I
basil I
gratis O

But O
I'd O
go O
back O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O

The O
food B
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B
impecable O

BUt O
their O
best O
dish B
is O
thh O
Thai B
spiced I
curry I
noodles I
with I
shrimp I
- O
a O
dish B
that O
would O
cost B
$2395 O
is O
most O
places O
but O
it O
is O
$16 O
here O

Good O
dark O
atmosphere B
and O
the O
music B
is O
a O
nice O
touch O

My O
husband O
said O
the O
portions B
were O
very O
small O
but O
if O
my O
main B
course I
was O
good O
to O
eat O
the O
portion B
would've O
been O
fine O
for O
me O

But O
the O
thai B
is O
definitely O
not O
great O
-- O
bland O
and O
indistinguished O

This O
Thai O
restaurant O
is O
a O
couple O
blocks O
away O
from O
Sripraphai O
another O
delicious O
Thai O
restaurant O

Great O
for O
groups O
great O
for O
a O
date O
great O
for O
early O
brunch B
or O
a O
nightcap B

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O

Our O
friendly O
server B
made O
great O
food B
suggestions I
and O
also O
sent O
both O
the O
sommelier B
and O
the O
fromager B
to O
the O
table O
to O
help O
suggest O
different O
pairings O
for O
wine B
and O
cheese B

Perhaps O
the O
last O
reviewer O
who O
stated O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
attitude O
lives O
in O
a O
parallel O
universe O
because O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
but O
a O
perfect O
experience O
at O
Yasuda O

That O
said O
I O
thought O
Scalini O
Fedeli O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
dining O
experiences O
I've O
EVER O
had O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant O
was O
special O

Because O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
reservation B
we O
could O
only O
sit O
in O
the O
back B
garden I
but O
it O
was O
great O
secluded O
and O
perfect O
in O
nice O
weather O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese B
food I
is O
a O
rare O
thing O

I O
try O
my O
best O
to O
give O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
any O
establishment O
visited O

While O
the O
food B
was O
good O
certainly O
no O
Il O
Mulino O
the O
service B
was O
horrendous O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O

Service B
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B
category I

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment B
in O
a O
restaurant O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations B
on O
weekends O
though O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
#1 O

Great O
pizza B
for O
lunch O
place O

The O
food B
was O
very O
expensive O
we O
spent O
$160 O
for O
lunch B
for O
two O
but O
extremely O
tasty O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
8 O
and O
well O
seved B

And O
that's O
no O
mean O
feat O

I O
often O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
family O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O

The O
signs B
the O
specials B
menus I
food B
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O

NO O
PIZZA O
33 O
for O
me O

I O
LOVE O
their O
spicy O
scallop B
roll I
and O
my O
boyfriend O
consistently O
gets O
the O
sesame B
chicken I

I'm O
no O
food B
critic O
but O
I'd O
like O
to O
think O
I O
have O
a O
tiny O
bit O
of O
experience O
under O
my O
belt O
having O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
the O
last O
11 O
years O

I O
noted O
it O
was O
crossed O
off O
on O
the O
bill B

Needless O
to O
say O
I'm O
never O
going O
back O
and O
you O
should O
be O
wary O
too O

Best O
dish B
is O
nori-wrapped B
tuna I

The O
food B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

Some O
servers B
make O
you O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
doing O
you O
a O
favor O
to O
bring O
you O
the O
food B

An O
excellent O
alternative O
to O
fast B
food B
joints O
and O
ordering O
in O
but O
the O
food B
was O
slightly O
disappointing O

Mermaid O
Inn O
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
another O
couple O

The O
staff B
is O
also O
attentive O
and O
friendly O

The O
all B
you I
can I
eat I
deal I
is O
truly O
amazing O
here O

That O
is O
a O
problem O
since O
we O
paid O
about O
20 O
bucks O
a O
dish B
and O
had O
to O
order O
5 O
dishes B
to O
get O
a O
decent O
taste B

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
place O
that O
provides O
the O
best O
experience O
though O
to O
both O
A-listers O
and O
people O
walking O
in O
off O
the O
street O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
$895 O
for O
four O
small O
meat B
patties I
in I
steamed I
buns I
and O
not O
worth O
trying O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price B
is O
even O
better O

It O
is O
about O
FOOD B
and O
Ambiance B
and O
imagine O
how O
dreadful O
it O
will O
be O
it O
we O
only O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
an O
idle O
engine O

The O
food B
was O
good O
too O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
the O
waiter B
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
okay O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O

The O
dining B
room I
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music B
to O
shout O
over O
-- O
how O
refreshing O

Admittedly O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
gigantic O
pieces O
of O
fish B
overflowing O
the O
plate O
and O
thank O
goodness O
in O
my O
opinion O
but O
for O
simple O
elegant O
sushi B
there O
is O
no O
better O
place O
in O
New O
York O
or O
anywhere O
in O
the O
US O

I O
am O
a O
die O
hard O
peep O
lover O

Once O
you O
become O
a O
regular O
you O
are O
treated O
as O
one O

The O
menu B
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
wide O
variety B
of I
dishes I
for O
seafood B
lovers O
and O
interesting O
ways O
of O
preparing O
them O

Everyone O
treats O
you O
like O
you O
were O
part O
of O
the O
family O

The O
white B
bean I
brushetta I
to O
start O
was O
incredible O
and O
the O
pasta B
was O
phenomenal O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B
is O
limited O
by O
everything O
is O
good O
eats B

The O
menu B
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
one O
on O
the O
website O

Great O
food B
great O
lay B
out I
and O
awesome O
service B

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B
attendant I
for O
a O
lotus B
leaf I
wrapped I
rice B
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice B
and O
just O
walked O
away O

SEA O
has O
become O
so O
popular O
that O
they've O
let O
it O
go O
to O
their O
heads O

We O
walked O
in O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B
promptly O

Chennai O
Garden O
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
very O
freindly O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O

Oh O
yeah O
ever O
on O
the O
west O
side O
try O
there O
sister O
resturant O
Arties O
Cafe O

Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place O

The O
waitstaff B
are O
all O
very O
busy O
it's O
not O
outstanding O
service B
but O
I've O
never O
been O
dealt O
with O
rudely O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste B
of O
the O
food B
and O
the O
feel B
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O

Not O
worth O
it O

In O
the O
evening O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
with O
it O
NY O
crowd O

They O
have O
it O
all O
-- O
great O
price B
food B
and O
service B

So O
close O
but O
not O
good O
enough O

This O
was O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
night O

Its O
also O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hassle O
to O
get O
to O
without O
a O
car O
I O
happen O
to O
live O
in O
Inwood O

The O
flavors B
are O
great O
and O
the O
menu B
is O
extensive O

The O
food B
was O
amazing O
the O
service B
was O
so O
attentive O
and O
personable O
and O
how O
about O
that O
ambience B

This O
place B
has O
the O
best O
interior B
I O
have O
seen O
anywhere O
in O
the O
northside O
of O
W'burg O
and O
will O
impress O
whoever O
you O
bring O
there O

The O
food B
has O
been O
consistant O
for O
years O
and O
it O
never O
lets O
you O
down O

I O
found O
the O
variety O
of O
the O
sashimi B
plate I
to O
be O
satisfying O
- O
fresh O
and O
yummy O

And O
forget O
what O
you O
read O
under O
me O
the O
atmosphere B
isn't O
that O
bad O
either O

Don't O
waste O
your O
time O
or O
money O

They O
don't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer's O
health O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O

We O
couldn't O
carry O
our O
conversation O
as O
we O
were O
routinely O
interrupted O
by O
waitress B
and O
servants B
asking O
us O
to O
order O
and O
hinting O
that O
we're O
taking O
too O
much O
time O
-- O
amazing O
we O
just O
sat O
down O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B
and O
ok O
service B

We O
just O
ate O
at O
Kai O
and O
were O
disapointed O

It's O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
mediocre O
food B
noise B
and O
a O
chance O
to O
be O
with O
their O
fellow O
bridge O
and O
tunnel O
folks O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O

After O
complaining O
about O
the O
chicken B
dish B
the O
manager B
came O
over O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
no O
one O
had O
ever O
complained O
before O
and O
that O
we O
just O
didn't O
know O
what O
the O
dish B
was O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O

The O
food B
was O
spicy O
and O
delicious O

I O
went O
with O
my O
fiance O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O

It O
was O
wonderful O

Went O
for O
a O
late O
weekday O
lunch B

I O
just O
don't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O

Bartender B
was O
unable O
to O
tear O
himself O
away O
from O
friends O
at O
bar B

Anyways O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food B
I O
wouldn't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O

Dahkin O
also O
offers O
prix B
fixe I
lunch I
and O
buffet B

Although O
the O
place B
could O
be O
a O
little O
more O
eye O
catching O
and O
roomier O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
doesn't O
really O
matter O

You O
can O
barely O
see O
who O
you O
are O
with O
never O
mind O
have O
a O
conversation O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
Bart's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B
and O
the O
service B
was O

I O
don't O
get O
it O
either O

Went O
on O
a O
double O
date O
with O
friend O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B
and O
appetizers B

Great O
place O
to O
grab O
a O
hot B
bagel I
on O
the O
way O
to O
work O

It's O
like O
they O
took O
leftover O
chicken B
poured O
oil B
and O
sprinkled O
pepper B
powder I
over O
it O
the O
sauce B
was O
translucent O
and O
red O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks B
- O
instead O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O

They O
brought O
glasses O
and O
the O
bottle O
and O
just O
left O
the O
bottle O
at O
our O
table O

We O
actually O
gave O
10% O
tip B
which O
we O
have O
never O
done O
despite O
mediocre O
food B
and O
service B
because O
we O
felt O
totally O
ripped O
off O

We O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
nice O
glass B
of I
Sangria I
when O
we O
arrived O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B
by I
the I
window I

While O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
food B
we O
were O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
poor O
service B
waiter B
was O
not O
quite O
competent O
and O
SLOW O
service B
and O
lack O
of O
remorse O

I O
for O
one O
will O
never O
patronize O
them O
again O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
we O
decided O
to O
try O

The O
service B
however O
was O
a O
bright O
flower O
in O
a O
garden O

So O
again O
give O
it O
a O
try O

Stay O
far O
away O
from O
this O
place O

We O
will O
come O
back O

We've O
been O
to O
Grocery O
three O
times O
and O
not O
once O
has O
an O
item O
on O
the O
menu B
disappointed O

The O
food B
is O
very O
good O
too O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
it's O
just O
regular O
food B
nothing O
special O

A O
touch O
more O
jalapeno B
heat O
for O
contrast O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
very O
good O
indeed O

Tried O
the O
pad B
see I
ew I
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
last O
reviewer O
since O
it's O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
dishes B

We'd O
go O
back O
again O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B
patio I
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B
is O
hear O
well O
there O

The O
location B
is O
perfect O

Guacamole+shrimp B
appetizer I
was O
really O
great O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B
very O
good O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B
that O
came O
with O
but O
the O
filet B
was O
so O
good O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O

The O
lunch B
special I
is O
an O
asbolute O
steal O

This O
food B
is O
asian-air O
fusion O

Nothing O
fancy O
but O
really O
good O
food B
with O
pretty O
reasonable O
price B

The B
chicken I
pot I
pie I
is O
excpetiona O
the O
cheeseburger B
huge O
and O
delictable O
and O
the O
service B
professional O
wan O
warm O

While O
I O
quite O
liked O
the O
food B
and O
the O
ambience B
I'm O
not O
quite O
sure O
if O
it O
they O
really O
deserve O
it O
the O
Michelin O
rating O
they O
have O
displayed O
so O
prooudly O
in O
the O
window O

i'm O
surprised O
about O
some O
of O
the O
bad O
reviews O
posted O
here O
- O
i've O
been O
to O
tamarind O
about O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
and O
always O
come O
away O
extremely O
satisfied O
and O
looking O
forward O
to O
returning O

But O
on O
a O
lazy O
Saturday O
night O
we O
ended O
up O
going O

There O
are O
a O
few O
Italian O
employees B
who O
may O
not O
speak O
the O
best O
English O
but O
for O
me O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
experience O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
however O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O

Once O
for O
dinner B
and O
once O
for O
brunch B

I've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe O
Spice O
probably O
5-8 O
times O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O

Not O
worth O
the O
prices B

Would O
recommend O
- O
perfect O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
close O
to O
grand O
central O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
enter O
till O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
out O
the O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
staff B
was O
was O
just O
Fantastic O

Service B
was O
good O
and O
food B
is O
wonderful O

I O
only O
have O
friends O

She O
gets O
10 O
for O
her O
excellent O
service B
and O
advice O

The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B

being O
a O
fan O
of O
spicy B
ethnic I
foods I
indian O
included O
i O
made O
friends O
with O
this O
place O
long O
ago O

Please O
save O
yourself O
the O
frustration O

And O
I O
say O
snacking B
because O
it O
really O
is O
not O
set O
up O
to O
be O
a O
proper O
dinner B

The O
quality B
of I
food I
at O
this O
restaurant O
accompanied O
 by O
fantastic O
live B
jazz I
makes O
this O
place O
a O
perfect O
10 O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
many O
times O
the O
food B
is O
always O
consistently O
outrageously O
good O

Always O
ask O
the O
bartender B
for O
the O
SEASONAL B
beer I

If O
your O
visiting O
you'll O
enjoy O
the O
ambiance B
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it's O
in O
Time O
Sq O

We O
were O
on O
our O
way O
back O
to O
NJ O
and O
since O
I O
am O
in O
NY O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
grab O
some O
food B

sandwiches B
tho O
pricey O
are O
over O
stuffed O
- O
can O
serve O
2 O
persons O
easily O
thus O
cost O
effective O

And O
comparing O
it O
to O
the O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
is O
simply O
not O
fair O

Service B
and O
food B
is O
what O
any O
one O
would O
expect O
when O
spending O
that O
type O
of O
money O

LOVE O
the O
atmosphere B
- O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
in O
Paris O

Every O
course B
was O
better O
than O
the O
next O

Not O
cheap O
but O
not O
that O
expensive O
either O

The O
staff B
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O

If O
presentation O
and O
service B
is O
your O
thing O
then O
this O
magic O
show O
works O

Apparently O
the O
good O
cook B
works O
then O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O

The O
Yellowtail B
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O

One O
less O
manhattanite O
the O
better O

Everyone O
is O
welcomed O
in O
as O
family O

I O
ate O
clams B
oreganta I
and O
spectacular O
salad B
with I
perfectly I
marinated I
cucumbers I
and I
tomatoes I
with I
lots I
of I
shrimp I
and I
basil I

The O
menu B
changed O
portions B
were O
even O
smaller O
than O
before O
a O
lentil B
dish I
was O
salty O
beyond O
edibility O
a O
basmati B
rice I
dish I
lacked O
flavor B

Spice O
is O
sleek O
modern O
and O
cool O
with O
a O
menu B
that O
will O
not O
hurt O
your O
wallet O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B
bar I
and O
has O
great O
staff B

Hey O
I O
think O
$2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ain't O
bad O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B

Look O
elsewhere O

More O
important O
the O
sushi B
rivals O
the O
best O
in O
Tokyo O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B
like O
this O

Bill B
a O
little O
high O
but O
worth O
it O

I O
seriously O
doubt O
I O
will O
ever O
dine O
at O
Jimmy's O
Bronx O
or O
for O
that O
matter O
Jimmy's O
Uptown O
again O

Everyone O
I O
bring O
here O
always O
loves O
it O

My O
co-workers O
had O
to O
wait O
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
delivery B
only O
to O
discover O
that O
what O
they O
got O
was O
not O
what O
they O
ordered O

Worth O
a O
visit O

A O
real O
dissapointment O

Its O
a O
go-to O
for O
dates O
as O
well O
as O
entertaining B
out O
of O
town O
guests O

Why O
do O
people O
rave O
about O
the O
ambience B

Were O
meeting O
up O
with O
some O
friends O
for O
a O
drink B
at O
Lafayette O
161 O
and O
happened O
to O
walk O
by O
Thai O
Angel O
famished O

Fluke B

the O

nicely O
highlighting O
the O

Great O
sushi B
experience O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
meal B
at O
a O
decent O
price B
go O
to O
Del O
Frisco's O

They O
charge O
$600 O
for O
rice B

My O
steak B
au I
poivre I
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
I've O
had O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant O
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O

The O
owner B
and O
staff B
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B

Try O
the O
congee B
and O
the O
donut B
like I
deep I
fried I
dough I
they I
call I
Ow I
Ley I
Soh I
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread B

Although O
the O
tables B
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
the O
candle-light B
food-quality B
and O
service B
overcompensate O

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiter B
was O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
considering O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
the O
first O
hour O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O

Would O
definitely O
visit O
again O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O

Perhaps O
this O
food B
is O
considered O
extreme O
to O
an O
Upper O
East O
Side O
resident O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
who've O
actually O
eaten O
ethnic B
food B
this O
is O
simply O
dull O

The O
place B
was O
real O
empty O
but O
that O
was O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
Sunday O
they O
ever O
opened O

This O
little O
place B
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B
for O
your O
money B

Ambience B
is O
delightful O
service B
impeccable O

Service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
AC B
worked O
very O
well O
too O
thank O
God O
it O
was O
hot O

Tasty O
but O
expensive O

You O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
people B
there O
care O
about O
their O
restaurant O
and O
about O
your O
experience O
and O
that O
is O
very O
nice O

Both O
are O
delicious O
the O
cooks B
are O
friendly O
and O
are O
willing O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
and O
speak O
to O
you O
and O
shake O
your O
hand O

so O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
change O
it O
up O
a O
bit O

My O
friend O
ordered O
some O
of O
their O
special O
sushi B
rolls I
which O
had O
excellent O
presentation O
and O
tasted O
great O

Although O
be O
warned O
their O
dinner B
menu I
to I
sit I
and O
take B
out I
prices B
are O
different O

The O
staff B
was O
accomodating O
the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B
is O
lovely O

PS O
Please O
don't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O

my O
picks O
are: O
 - O
Scallion B
Pancake I
fried O
with O
vegetable B
juice I
very O
special O
and O
tasty O
 - O
Guizhou B
Chicken I
 - O
Shredded B
Squid I
Family I
Style I
one O
of O
my O
personal O
favorites O
 - O
Sichuan B
Spicy I
Soft I
Shell I
Crab I
 - O
Shuizhu B
Fish I
this O
one O
is O
for O
hardcore O
Sichuan B
food I
fans I
I I
wouldn't I
recommend O
to O
my O
American O
friends O
as O
it's O
very O
spicy O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned B
vegetables I
like O
the O
spinach B
mushroom I
calzone I

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food B

There O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
6 O
Blue B
Point I
oysters I
and O
a O
beer B
or O
glass B
of I
wine I
for O
$8 O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
noodle B
dishes I
at O
Rice O
Avenue O
compared O
to O
their O
Green B
Curry I
dish I

I O
went O
to O
pams O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
i O
love O
it O

But O
for O
whatever O
reason O
prices B
are O
about O
twice O
as O
high O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O

Great O
atmoshere B
and O
worth O
every O
bit O

We O
had O
a O
most O
unpleasant O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O

The O
spicy B
tuna I
roll I
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B
shrimp I
tempura I
was O
awesome O
great O
appetizer B
to O
share O

The O
staff B
was O
knowledgeable O
and O
full O
of O
personality O

Great O
staff B

Only O
complaint O
would O
be O
that O
at O
an O
average O
cost B
of O
$12-$15 O
per O
meal B
I'd O
like O
not O
to O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
finding O
a O
seat B

To O
finish O
off O
such O
a O
delightful O
dinner B
experience O
you O
must O
have O
dessert B
especially O
the O
White B
Chocolate I
Bread I
Pudding I
with I
Gelato I
and I
hot I
chocolate I

The O
banana B
tower I
is O
an O
amazing O
dessert B
as O
well O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O

Excellent O
atmosphere B
delicious O
dishes B
good O
and O
friendly O
service B

A O
cool O
place B
to O
hang O
with O
your O
friends O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
healthy O
drinks B
and O
desserts B

Great O
vibe B
lots O
of O
people O

I O
like O
Mamoun's O
food B
as O
well O
but O
side O
by O
side O
Kati O
Rolls O
just O
produce O
tastier O
food B
hands O
down O

Just O
an O
odd O
group O

The O
service B
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
but O
harkens O
back O
to O
my O
years O
growing O
up O
in O
Napoli O
Italy O
where O
things O
are O
not O
rushed O
and O
when O
you O
sit O
down O
for O
dinner B
the O
table B
is O
yours O
all O
night O

Either O
that O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O

I O
love O
this O
place O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O

But O
that O
wasn't O
the O
icing B
on I
the I
cake: I
a O
tiramisu B
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O

Great O
food B
and O
the O
prices B
are O
very O
reasonable O

Wine B
list I
is O
not O
huge O
but O
def O
well O
selected O

A O
cool O
bar B
with O
great O
food B
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
and O
always O
delicious O
specials B

The O
ambience B
is O
authentic O
and O
relaxing O
and O
we O
have O
always O
received O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
service B

Fresh O
authentic O
french B
cuisine I
in O
substantial O
portions B

Drinks B
got O
screwed O
up O
she O
acted O
put O
upon O

The O
one O
vegetarian B
entree I
Abby's B
treasure I
was O
actually O
quite O
a O
surprise O
- O
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
had O
wintermelon B
covering O
an O
assortment B
of I
fresh I
mushrooms I
and I
vegetables I

At O
5 O
dumplings B
for O
$1 O
you O
just O
cannot O
go O
wrong O

But O
the O
pizza B
is O
way O
to O
expensive O

And O
the O
staff B
is O
also O
young O
energeic O
and O
hot O

Even O
better O
they O
know O
how O
to O
cook O
French O
classics O
like O
Steak B
au I
Poivre I
and O
Onglet B
without O
burning O
it O
to O
death O
or O
overcooking O
it O

Service B
was O
decent O
but O
not O
as O
smooth O
as O
I O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
place O
with O
these O
prices B
and O
reputation B

We O
had O
a O
wonderful O
meal B
at O
Naples O
45 O
a O
month O
ago O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
NYC O

Good O
drink B

Great O
food B
spinach B
and I
corn I
dumplings I
and O
massamman B
curry I
very O
friendly O
and O
no O
nonsense O
service B
and O
a O
clean O
and O
funky O
bathroom B

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O

We O
had O
a O
girls' O
night O
dinner B
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O

Romantic O
if O
you O
want O
it O
to O
be O
brightly O
lit O

However O
I O
was O
there O
for O
a O
work O
dinner B
not O
long O
ago O
when O
my O
colleague O
from O
London O
noticed O
a O
very O
large O
waterbug O
on O
the O
ceiling B

I O
recommend O
it O

I O
have O
taken O
practically O
every O
guest O
that O
has O
come O
to O
visit O
me O
in O
NY O
and O
hooked O
a O
few O
New O
Yorkers O
onto O
Peep O
as O
well O

enough O
said O

I O
don't O
live O
in O
NY O
but O
my O
best O
friend O
does O

My O
chow B
fun I
and I
chow B
see I
was I
really I
bland I
and O
oily O

Even O
though O
I O
made O
the O
reservation B
at O
3pm O
for O
the O
same O
night O
through O
Dinnerbroker O
we O
were O
seated B
at O
a O
table B
with O
one O
of O
the O
best O
view O

we O
did O
notice O
however O
that O
some O
tables O
had O
what O
looked O
like O
pita B
instead O
of O
naan B

I O
didn't O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
rest O
menu B
but O
the O
oysters B
were O
fantastic O

After O
the O
review O
I O
treked O
into O
Brooklyn O

The O
grilled B
cheese I
at O
home O
afterwards O
was O
better O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
greeted O

The O
red O
sliding O
doors B
may O
be O
unique O
but O
they O
do O
not O
block O
off O
the O
cold O
air O
from O
the O
outside O

Great O
service B
great O
food B

The O
food B
is O
expensive O
but O
worth O
every O
bite O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B
and O
bad O
service B
sometimes O
i O
get O
good B
good B
and O
bad O
service B

When O
we O
were O
finally O
seated O
our O
waitress B
came O
by O

for O
our O
order O
and O

In O

perfect O
restaurant O
for O
NY O

eating O
and O
hanging O
at O
the O
pink O

Recommendations O
of O

are O
required O

We O
did O
have O
to O
wait O
at O
the O
bar B
for O
approx O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O

Yeah O
it's O
that O
good O

If O
you O
love O
seafood B
you O
would O
love O
this O
place B

Good O
fast O
service B

Dakshin O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
affordable O
and O
tasty O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
upper O
east O
side O

They O
charge O
different O
prices B
all O
the O
time O

To O
dine O
at O
Thalia O
can O
be O
slightly O
deceiving O
because O
while O
its O
beautiful O
on O
the O
outside O
its O
so O
bland O
on O
the O
inside O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service B
and O
overpriced O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
experienced O
amazing O
cheese B
and O
a O
delicious O
new O
summer O
menu B
at O
Artisanal O
last O
night O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O

It's O
charmingly O
small O
and O
that O
leads O
to O
an O
atmoshere B
that O
is O
extremely O
cozy O
and O
romantic O
even O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B
cuisine I

In O
terms O
of O
the O
food B
itself O
-- O
nothing O
special O
we O
limited O
ourselves O
to O
several O
appetizers B

Love O
the O
Jazz B
bands I
on O
Fri O
and O
Sat O

Overall O
excellent O
restaurant O

To O
begin O
we O
were O
told O
there O
was O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B
and O
started O
to O
leave O
when O
the O
hostess B
offered O
to O
call O
us O
on O
our O
cell O
phone O
when O
the O
table B
was O
ready O

The O
servers B
give O
you O
some O
sample O
slices O
of O
your O
order O
while O
you O
wait O
shortly O
I O
might O
add O

The O
service B
was O
ok O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish B
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald's O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O
While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O

I O
ate O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
absolutely O
loved O
it O

Don't O
expect O
to O
sit O
down O
inside O
though O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
tables B
and O
they O
are O
always O
full O

The O
staff B
is O
accomodating O
the O
ambiance B
is O
exciting O
and O
yet O
relaxed O
and O
the O
food B
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B
special I
my O
husband O
had O
steak B
and O
the O
service B
was O
top-notch O

The O
manager B
claimed O
that O
he O
could O
not O
compensate O
us O
for O
anything O
on O
the O
bill B
which O
just O
shows O
the O
lack O
of O
sophistication O
from O
the O
entire O
group O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

But O
too O
far O
east O

Satisfying O

Highly O
Highly O
Highly O
recommended O

it's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B
comfort I
food I

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B
price I
sushi I
deal I
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O

we O
came O
here O
on O
a O
crowded O
saturday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B
right O
away O
despite O
being O
15 O
minutes O
late O
for O
our O
reservation B

This O
place O
is O
cool O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
but O
French O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
could O
be O
in O
a O
bistro O
in O
a O
back O
alley O
in O
Paris O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer B
platter I
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O

The O
staff B
are O
attentive O
and O
have O
smiles O
on O
their O
faces O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu-Shabu O
Restaurant O
in O

Try-State O
Area O

No O
dress B

here O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B
there O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings B
in O
the O
appetizer B
section O

Maybe O
I O
say O
so O
because O
it O
looked O
promising O
for O
people O
who O
like O
artery-clogging O
jewish B
deli I
food I
but O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
poorly O
run O
and O
awful O

After O
my O
3rd O
time O
the O
manager B
remembered O
me O
and O
treated O
me O
like O
an O
usual O
customer O

This O
place O
is O
greatly O
welcome O
in O
the O
desolate O
little O
strip O
between O
the O
Prospect O
Expressway O
and O
Greenwood O
Cemetery O
- O
a O
wasteland O
we O
like O
to O
call O
The O
Sliv O

now O
if O
they O
could O
only O
get O
a O
toaster B

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O

When O
he's O
not O
making O
authentic O
Neapolitan B
pizza I
in O
the O
open O
brick O
oven O
or O
lightly O
frying O
zucchini B
blossoms I
he's O
visiting O
the O
regulars O
a O
growing O
legion O
and O
checking O
on O
newcomers O

Wait B
staff I
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B
on O
the O
UWS O

The O
ingredients B
taste O
fresher O
the O
crust B
is O
thinner O
and O
crispier O
the O
slice B
is O
less O
oily O
and O
it's O
never O
burnt O
like O
it O
occasionally O
is O
at O
Joe's O

Fish B
is O
so O
very O
fresh O

The O
prices B
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B
and O
food B

Go O
only O
if O
you O
are O
already O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
don't O
want O
to O
bother O
going O
farther O
for O
a O
better O
place O

Top O
spot O
in O
town O
for O
Vietnamese B
classics I
better O
than O
places O
that O
cost O
a O
lot O
more O

less O
wait B
time I
for O
me O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
relaxing O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O

The O
decor B
is O
really O
blah O
and O
not O
at O
all O
hip O
or O
happening O

Having O
discovered O
Ping's O
on O
the O
internet O
we O
entered O
with O
qualms O
but O
were O
instantly O
put O
to O
ease O
by O
the O
fish B
tanks I
that O
greet O
you O
as O
u O
walk O
in O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red O
Eye O
Grill O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
owner's O
first O
venture O
and O
it O
shows O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
and O
I'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B
in O
Fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B
and O
noodle B
soup I
dishes I
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu B
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B
cheeses I
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B
are O
great O

The O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B
with I
Scallops I
and I
Shrimp I
is O
great O

The O
food B
was O
authentic O

The O
dim B
sum I
is O
delectable O
while O
the O
prices B
are O
quite O
easy O
on O
the O
wallet O

I O
only O
tried O
a O
simple O
dish B
of O
spinach B
ravioli I
in I
a I
light I
oil I
and I
garlic I
sauce I
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
NYC O
Italian O
joints O
I've O
tried O
similar O
dishes B
at O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B
food I
I've O
ever O
encountered O

A O
million O
better O
places O
to O
go O
in O
the O
city O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O

Okay-i O
don't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O

I O
ordered O
a O
Chicken B
Teriyaki I
dish I
and O
found O
that O
the O
chicken B
was O
extremely O
dry O

I O
love O
it O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O

We O
had O
reservations B
at O
9pm O
but O
was O
not O
seated O
until O
10:15pm O

We O
had O
Pam's B
special I
fried I
fish I
and O
it O
was O
amazing O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B

Three O
strikes O
and O
this O
restaurant O
is O
out O

We O
bring O
in O
a O
party O
of O
ten O
or O
so O
every O
week O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B
England I
Chowder I
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B
Bisque I

So O
a O
little O
inconsistency O
there O
but O
either O
way O
both O
pizzas B
were O
really O
good O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi B
favorites O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O

We O
would O
return O
to O
this O
place O
again O

Not O
enough O
wines B
by I
the I
glass I
either O

I O
had O
the O
duck B
breast I
special I
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O

I O
must O
say O
it's O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
food B
because O
it O
was O
not O
as O
spectacular O
as O
the O
view O

These O
innovators O
of O
french B
indian I
fusion I
do O
a O
great O
job O
of O
making O
dishes B
as O
interesting O
as O
possible O
while O
still O
being O
accessible O

Just O
don't O
take O
the O
seat B
between O
the O
bar B
and O
the O
back O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
i O
saw O
a O
woman O
get O
nudged O
40times O
sitting O
there O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
-- O
the O
food B
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B
shrimp I
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
and O
I'm O
a O
eater O

One O
should O
not O
go O
to O
Lucky O
Strike O
for O
the O
food B

The O
service B
is O
awful--the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
and O
I O
do O
mean O
the O
last O
time O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
needed O
our O
table B
so O
we O
would O
have O
to O
leave O

We O
could O
only O
get O
through O
an O
appetizer B
and O
cheese B
fondue I

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
cute O
artsy O
interesting O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
it O
is O
all O
good O

Both O
times O
we O
waited O
well O
over O
a O
half O
hour O
for O
a O
table B
even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations B

happy O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
at O
this O
place O
and O
would O
warmly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O

I've O
been O
eating O
at O
Taj O
Mahal O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
and O
have O
found O
them O
to O
be O
the O
most O
excellent O
of O
the O
Indian O
eateries O
on O
this O
block O
of O
Indian O
restaurants O

night O
without O
a O
reservation B
we O
had O
to O
wait B
at O
the O
bar B
for O
a O
little O
while O
but O
the O
manager B
was O
so O
nice O
and O
made O
our O
wait B
a O
great O
experience O

Try O
the O
green B
curry I

We O
had O
the O
scallops B
as O
an O
appetizer B
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
wonderful O

We O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation B
and O
the O
service B
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O

You O
rarely O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
seat B
and O
the O
currys B
masaman I
green I
red I
are O
full O
of O
flavor B
and O
come O
super O
spicy O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
it O

The O
food B
there O
are O
sastifying O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
try O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner B
and O
drinks B

The O
bar B
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B
and O
well O
priced B
wines B

I O
agree O

Last O
memorial O
day O
I O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B
but O
was O
told O
they O
were O
closed O
that O
weekend O
interesting O
but O

The O
food B
was O
good O

Great O
wine B
selection I
Gigondas B
is O
worth O
the O
price B
and O
the O
house B
champagne I
is O
a O
great O
value O

at O
night O
but O
it's O
hard O
to O
hear O
your O
own O
conversation O
with O
everyone O
else O
competing O
for O
that O
same O
luxury O
- O
the O
music B
playing O
in O
the O
background O
is O
also O
voluminous O

It O
just O
wasn't O
Thai O

I O
have O
enjoyed O
everything O
I O
have O
ever O
gotten O
and O
the O
fish B
is O
so O
fresh O
and O
always O
prepared O
in O
a O
great O
way O

I O
particularly O
love O
their O
yellowfun B
tuna I
and O
their O
mussel B
selection I

I O
love O
to O
visit O
Murrays O
for O
my O
bagel B
fix O

We O
made O
early O
dinner B
reservations I
and O
were O
thoroughly O
impressed O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
grandfather O
its O
old O
school O
Italian O
scenery B
with O
lots O
of O
fun O
stuff O
to O
admire O

Recommended O

The O
place B
was O
nice O
and O
calm O

Cheese B
plate I
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$10 O

I O
could O
have O
drank O
4 O
glasses B
of I
water I
and O
still O
been O
parched O
- O
so O
watch O
out O

When O
we O
sat O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B

Most O
of O
the O
servers B
are O
very O
attentive O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O

I O
think O
locals O
rate O
this O
place O
so O
high O

Service B
is O
average O

But O
they've O
done O
a O
really O
nice O
job O
of O
offering O
all O
the O
typical O
pizzeria O
faves O
plus O
some O
terrific O
specials B
like O
the O
Godmother B
pizza I
a I
sort I
of I
traditional I
flat I
pizza I
with I
an I
olive I
oil-brushed I
crust I
and I
less I
tomato I
sauce I
than I
usual I

Go O
girls O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich B
didn't O
include O
plastic B
forks I
and O
didn't O
include O
pita B
with O
the O
hummus B
platter I

The O
steak B
is O
good O
the O
fish B
is O
good O
and O
the O
sushi B
was O
surprisingly O
great O

For O
asian O
fusion O
there O
are O
many O
places O
further O
downtown O

Old O
school O
meets O
New O
world O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O

The O
service B
was O
poor O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
staff B
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald's O
than O
this O
joint O

This O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
my O
new O
favorite O
places O

For O
being O
number O
1 O
this O
place O
has O
alot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
order O
to O
truly O
earn O
its O
so O
called O
reputation O

For O
myself O
and O
family O
we O
would O
only O
go O
here O
to O
celebrate O
an O
occassion O
I O
do O
prefer O
smaller O
quiter O
restaurants O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O

They O
all O
know O
you O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
still O
choose O
to O
eat O
there O
a O
lot O
because O
of O
diverse O
cocktails B
the O
chill O
decor B
and O
the O
decent O
sushi B

We O
ended O
the O
dinner B
with O
a O
surprisingly O
light O
and O
flaky O
apple B
tarte I
tatin I

The O
buffet B
had O
a O
nice O
selection B

Waitstaff B
are O
very O
friendly O

This O
restaurant O
is O
such O
a O
great O
place O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette O
you're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
off-the-beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O

I've O
been O
several O
times O
and O
am O
totally O
smitten O

Terrible O
experience O

I O
love O
the O
place O

Service B
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food B
although O
not O
crowded O

Will O
have O
to O
return O
to O
try O
the O
chocolate B

It's O
only O
$195 O
for O
a O
regular O
slice O
and O
$400 O
for O
a O
slice O
with O
a O

that O
have O
visited O

The O
food B
was O
below O
average O
the O
service B
was O
pathetic O
there O
was O
no O
ambience B
at O
all O

I O
REALLY O
ENJOYED O
THE O
SHOWS B
PUT O
ON O
BY O
THE O
ACTORS B

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New B
York I
and I
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New B
York I
Bagel I

service B
was O
efficient O
courteous O

this O
one O
is O
definintely O
my O
least O
favorite O

I O
have O
been O
urged O
by O
friends O
for O
months O
to O
check O
out O
the O
mermaid O
inn O

The O
miso B
soup I
lacked O
flavor B
and O
the O
fish B
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O

Everytime O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
go O
there O
we O
are O
never O
disappointed O

They O
are O
the O
best O
bagels B
I've O
had O

We O
were O
not O
disappointed O

I've O
read O
some O
of O
the O
previews O
reviews O
- O
people O
are O
either O
not O
New O
Yorkers O
or O
have O
more O
appreciation O
for O
ambience B
then O
food B

Toons O
has O
recently O
been O
redone O
so O
it's O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space B

$160 O
for O
2 O
filets B
2 O
sides B
an O
appetizer B
and O
drinks B

While O
the O
prices B
are O
nothing O
special O
the O
portions B
are O
huge O

Its O
a O
nice O
quiet O
location B
to O
go O
eat O
a O
good O
meal B
relax O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
and O
have O
a O
very O
good O
time O

We O
arrived O
for O
dinner B
expecting O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
a O
place O
that O
has O
an O
impressive O
past O
- O
but O
that's O
just O
it O
-- O
the O
PAST O

However O
I O
think O
this O
place O
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot B

The O
menu B
is O
Prix B
Fixe I
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
$60 O
per O
person O
but O
it O
is O
Well O
worth O
itsuperb O
food B

Rao O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
but O
it's O
nothing O
special O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O

We O
had O
the O
most O
wonderful O
waitress B

While O
the O
staff B
at O
this O
little O
bistro O
is O
very O
friendly O
I O
have O
never O
experienced O
more O
incompetency O

The O
quail B
was O
fantastic O
and O
unique O
and O
the O
pastas B
were O
full O
of O
flavor B

When O
we O
left O
at O
8:00 O
PM O
it O
was O
packed O
and O
noisy O

Okay O
so O
I O
never O
write O
but O
there O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
fair O
balance O
of O
positive O
to O
negative O
reviews O
concerning O
Green O
Bo O
and O
it's O
time O
to O
speak O
up O
- O
I O
live O
in O
Chinatown O

The O
zucchini B
and O
mashed B
potatoes I
are O
a O
blend O
of O
garlic B
and O
butter B
which O
simply O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O

The O
staff B
is O
courteous O
and O
friendly O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O

Decor B
is O
nice O
though O
service B
can O
be O
spotty O

Aside O
from O
the O
rushed O
service B
we O
were O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
and O
the O
drinks B

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B
Scallop I
roll I
 
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
fine O
Indian B
dining I
experience I
that O
is O
definitely O
a O
value O
for O
your O
dollar O

And O
even O
with O
it's O
Pub B
atmosphere I
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O

This O
big O
draw O
is O
the O
all O
you O
can O
sushi B
here O
for O
$1995 O

I O
consider O
the O
best O
Grand O
Sichuan O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O

we O
spent O
50 O
$$ O
definetly O
will O
come O
back O
with O
my O
friends O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O

Some O
of O
the O
workers B
ignore O
me O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
female O
customers O
other O
times O
they've O
skipped O
my O
order B

The O
specials B
are O
usually O
quite O
good O
too O

They've O
the O
best O
desserts B
and O
mixed B
drinks I
as O
well O
as O
snack B
foods I

Try O
the O
chocolate B
mud I
cake I
warmed I
with O
2 O
scoops O
of O
dulce B
de I
leche I
gelato I

That's O
good O
and O
bad O

Really O
cool O
stauff B
inside O

While O
the O
new O
restaurant O
still O
features O
much O
of O
the O
same O
classical B
furniture I
that O
made O
Tiffin O
so O
attractive O
the O
menu B
has O
been O
overhauled O

The O
best O
burger B
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
Village O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$35 O
menu B

I O
would O
have O
gotten O
some O
cole B
slaw I
and O
a O
knish B
if O
my O
stomach O
had O
more O
space O

came O
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
didn't O
save O
much O
but O
it O
was O
still O
great O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O

Three O
of O
us O
arrived O
for O
dinner B
about O
5:30 O
on O
a O
week O
night O
without O
reservations B

The O
blond B
wood I
decor I
is O
very O
soothing O
the O
premium O
sake B
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B
is O
great O

There O
is O
usually O
a O
wait B
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O

Be O
careful O
when O
they O
say O
spicy O
they O
mean O
it O

Your O
money B
could O
easily O
be O
better O
spent O
elsewhere O
Anywhere O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel B
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs B
for O
the O
bagel B

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B
of I
wine I
while O
we O
waited O

Bring O
your O
appetites O

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
pleasant O
fun O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* O
way O

Of O
course O
this O
atmosphere B
is O
lacking O
but O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
24 O
hour O
bagel B
place O
anyways O

Service B
was O
very O
good O
and O
warm O

For O
dinner B
I O
had O
the O
chicken B
tikka-masala I
and O
some O
garlic B
naan I

Cornelia O
Street O
looks O
like O
a O
Broadway O
set O
for O
West O
Side O
Story O
and O
the O
inside O
of O
Po O
is O
so O
cool O
quaint O
you O
really O
can't O
top O
the O
setting B
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B
in O
NYC O

Like O
others O
have O
said O
don't O
expect O
the O
restaurant O
to O
make O
a O
nite O
out O
romantic O
for O
you O
and O
yes O
a O
busy O
restaurant O
may O
require O
you O
to O
wait O

Seriously O
this O
place O
kicks O
ass O

Food B
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B
of O
the O
new O
york O
city O
skiline O
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O

Also O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O

The O
food B
is O
nothing O
like O
its O
menu B
description I

Try O
the O
Pad B
Se-Ew I
or O
Chicken B
with I
Cashew I
Nuts I
for O
a O
memorable O
and O
repeatable O
experience O

It's O
just O
OK O
pizza B

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O

I've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O

The O
food B
is O
decent O
at O
best O
and O
the O
ambience B
well O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O

THE O
BEST O
PLACE O
TO O
BRING O
KIDS O
OR O
ANY O
FRIENDS O
WHO O
WANT O
TO O
DO O
SOMETHING O
DIFFERENT O

The O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
but O
they O
were O
very O
friendly O

However O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
extraordinary O
hype O
about O
this O
restaurant O

It's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant O

I O
will O
be O
returning O

Leon O
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem: O
casual O
but O
hip O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French B
bistro I
fare I
good O
specials B
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B

The O
food B
is O
above O
average O
for O
midtown O
and O
sligtly O
better O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Heartland O
Breweries O
in O
the O
city O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu-Shabu B

The O
food B
was O
absolutely O
horrible O

Food B
doesn't O
appear O
to O
be O
cooked O
on O
premisis O
but O
there's O
a O
high O
turnover O
so O
its O
pretty O
fresh O

Restaurant O
was O
dirty O
and O
unkempt O

Nice O
place O
though O

Warning: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu O

Similar O
to O
other O
Indian O
restaurants O
they O
use O
the O
dinner B
special I
to O
attract O
customers O
at O
the O
door O

It O
is O
a O
small O
restuarant O
so O
go O
early O
and O
it O
will O
be O
nice O
and O
quiet- O
go O
late O
and O
it O
will O
be O
packed O

The O
people B
with I
carts I
of I
food B
don't O
understand O
you O
because O
they O
don't O
speak O
English O
their O
job O
is O
to O
give O
you O
the O
delicious O
food B
you O
point O
at O

The O
crackling B
calamari I
salad I
which O
is O
usually O
a O
cheap O
disaster O
at O
many O
restaurants O
is O
crispy O
and O
lightly O
dressed O

Not O
the O
greatest O
sushi B
place I
but O
excellent O
for O
a O
$1995 O
all O
you O
can O
eat O

Shockingly O
easy O
to O
throw O
a O
group B
dinner I
here: O
simple O
contract O
deposit O
only O
to O
hold O
the O
date O
the O
entire O
2nd O
fl O
mezz O
for O
our O
grp O
of O
20 O

The O
Thai B
ice I
tea I
was O
amazingly O
smooth O
and O
yummy O

We've O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
staff B
but O
maybe O
we've O
been O
lucky O

Drinks B
way O
over O
priced B

The O
main O
downside O
to O
the O
place O
is O
the O
nazi-like O
guy B
running O
it O
who O
constantly O
complains O
about O
the O
noise B
level I

What O
I O
didn't O
like O
was O
how O
the O
food B
came O
right O
after O
it O
was O
ordered O

But O
WARNING: O
to O
all O
those O
that O
use O
this O
site O
be O
weary O
be O
very O
weary O
of O
recommendations O

Moderate O
prices B

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
hyde O
Pub O
last O
night O

Try O
it O
side O
by O
side O
and O
there's O
no O
comparison O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O

My O
biggest O
complaint O
was O
the O
un-tasty O
food B
although O
presented O
well O

This O
tiny O
restaurant O
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O

So O
sorry O
I O
can't O
rate O
this O
better O

Most O
importantly O
food B
is O
excellent O

Buon O
appetito O

Great O
roofdeck B
nice O
group O
of O
30 O
somethings O
but O
no O
music B
kind O
of O
quiet O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant O

The O
best O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
knowing O
that O
the O
manager B
a O
bubbly O
friendly O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
truly O
cared O
about O
how O
we O
were O
doing O

Ok O
for O
all O
of O
us O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
Village O
of O
NYC O
we O
have O
spoiled O
by O
a O
plethora O
of O
restaurants O
most O
of O
which O
stay O
open O
very O
late O

However O
service B
was O
as O
plain O
as O
sesame B
crusted I
Salmon I
I O
had O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch B
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O

The O
food B
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE O

So O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
are O
accurate O
about O
the O
crowd B
and O
noise B

You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
with O
that O
logic O
in O
mind O
Spice O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
grab O
some O
cheap O
eats B
and O
drinks B
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B

Finally O
after O
all O
the O
raving O
I O
went O
to O
check O
it O
out O
with O
one O
of O
my O
enthusiastic O
friends O
this O
last O
Saturday O
night O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
its O
all O
its O
cracked O
up O
to O
be O

Place O
should O
also O
have O
a O
123 O
chili O
rating O
to O
be O
more O
authentic O

The O
service B
was O
terrible O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served B

Went O
last O
Thursday O

I O
love O
this O
place O
more O
and O
more O
everytime O
i O
go O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place O
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O

Other O
than O
being O
a O
little O
crowded O
and O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
filled O
with O
energy O
and O
the O
beautiful O
people B
of O
course O
and O
the O
food B
was O
surprising O
good O

We O
only O
ordered O
desserts B
and O
drinks B
but O
no O
refills O
were O
offered O

Saul O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O

Waiters B
are O
slow O
but O
sweet O

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B
once O
for O
brunch B
and O
twice O
for O
lunch B

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O

the O
real O
kicker O
of O
the O
menu B
however O
is O
the O
beef B
cubes I
or O
the O
chicken B
with I
chili I
and I
lemon I
grass I

It O
was O
good O
but O
was O
not O
what O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O

The O
music B
is O
the O
best O
among O
all O
the O
Indian O
restaurants O
I O
have O
visited O

The O
bread B
and O
lamb B
chops I
I O
had O
before O
the O
meal B
were O
quite O
good O
however O

He O
always O
says O
I O
don't O
have O
customers O

Rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service B
and O
atmosphere B
in O
NYC O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer B
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles B
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar B
and O
threw O
our O
dishes B
on O
the O
table O

one O
of O
the O
best O
Chicken B
Tikka I
Masala I

Excellent O
dumplings B
served O
amid O
clean O
chic O
decor B

The O
kitchen B
however O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O

The O
corned B
beef I
and O
pastrami B
are O
excellent O
much O
less O
fatty O
than O
those O
big O
tourist O
places O
around O
Times O
Square O

Cute O
place B
nice O
wait B
staff I
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O

Also O
the O
hostess B
called O
me O
today O
to O
thank O
us O
for O
coming O
and O
mentioned O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
my O
girlfriend O
enjoyed O
her O
birthday O
- O
unexpected O
but O
a O
truly O
above O
and O
beyond O
thing O
to O
do O

people B
are O
rude O
bit O
again O
it's O
new O
york O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

The O
plain B
slice I
is O
great O
and O
if O
you O
get O
toppings B
the O
whole O
slice O
is O
topped O
with O
them O
not O
sparsely O
sprinkled O
on O
like O
some O
places O

Service B
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B
is O
not O
that O
great O

Service B
is O
great O
takeout B
is O
good O
too O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
on O
here O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overwhelmed O
after O
the O
7 O
PM O

The O
pizza B
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O

Everything O
is O
excellent O
the O
menu B
is O
quite O
extensive O
and O
you O
eat O
with O
a O
view B
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
city O

You'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
and O
most O
still O
don't O
compare O

For O
the O
quality B
of I
food I
a O
little O
too O
expensive O

Came O
looking O
for O
this O
place O
because O
I O
heard O
good O
things O

I O
live O
on O
the O
street O
this O
place O
is O
on O

Horrible O

Here's O
to O
the O
fake O
fish B
tanks I
too O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait B
though O

I've O
never O
had O
bad O
service B
and O
the O
fish B
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B
jazz I
band I
and O
atmosphere B
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B
Cobb I
Salad I

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
in O
tea B
room I
which O
was O
small O
and O
cute O

What O
an O
amazing O
meal B
and O
experience O

Unique O
apppetizers B

The O
staff B
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
kind O
and O
I've O
always O
been O
amazed O
at O
how O
they've O
handled O
all O
the O
various O
different O
group O
sizes O
that O
come O
in O

IT O
is O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
town O
for O
a O
Monday O
night O
dinner B
at O
a O
fine O
restaurant O

Nothing O
special O
about O
this O
place O

Also O
the O
sandwiches B
nearing O
$7 O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips B
or O
a O
side B

and O
never O
strayed O

The O
wait B
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim B
sum I
but O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
sharing O
tables B
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim B
sum I
atmosphere O
is O
not O
your O
gig O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
for O
Chinatown O
alternative O

Leave O
the O
kids O
at O
home O

This O
place O
has O
good O
potential O
but O
needs O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
work O
before O
we O
can O
justify O
spending O
that O
much O
money B
on O
indian B
food I
you O
can O
get O
everywhere O
else O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
the O
decor B
cool O
and O
understated O

And O
all O
of O
that O
won't O
break O
your O
bank O

The O
Thai B
food I
is O
good O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O

Great O
selection B
of I
wine I
and O
seafood B

delicious O

Acceptable O
prices B

Big O
thumbs O
up O

we O
were O
seated O
at O
the O
sushi B
bar I
in O
front O
of O
yasuda O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O

As O
I O
made O
the O
title O
it's O
an O
affordable O
restaurant O
for O
great O
taste B

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
price B

Orsay O
is O
a O
very O
pleasnt O
throw O
back O
to O
traditional O
French B
food I
and O
French B
service B
as O
well O

It's O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
table B
for O
a O
large O
group O
and O
you O
don't O
get O
hustled O
out O

Great O
food B
at O
reasonable O
prices B

Salads B
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal B

I O
ordered O
tamarind B
duck I
and O
my O
wife O
ordered O
noodles B
with I
ground I
beef I
and O
we O
were O
both O
delighted O
by O
the O
way O
the O
dishes B
evoked O
Thai B
flavors I
in O
unexpected O
ways O

That's O
why O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
more O
for O
that O

If O
you've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O

I O
loved O
it O

They're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
Queens O

The O
prices B
are O
about O
$9 O
for O
an O
entree B
for O
dinner B
and O
even O
less O
for O
lunch B

and O
you O
can't O
beat O
the O
prices B

but O
I O
wouldn't O
wanna O
live O
there O

Arigato O
Gozimas O
Yuka O

Should O
you O
happen O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
the O
cuisine B
definitely O
try O
it O

I O
had O
the O
black B
cod I
with I
yuzu I
sauce I
which O
was O
wonderful O

Prices B
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
the O
rare O
choices O
for O
me O
to O
go O
in O
Brooklyn O

This O
quiet O
dark O
asian O
bistro O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
trip O

I O
knew O
upon O
visiting O
NYC O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
an O
orginal O
deli O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O

Total O
hipster-wannabe O
attitude O
in O
an O
otherwise O
sweet O
spot B

Yes O
there O
might O
be O
a O
wait B
if O
you O
have O
no O
reservations B

Thank O
You O
Emilio O

First O
of O
all O
Dal O
Bukhara O
Rocks O

Everything O
from O
the O
soft O
bread B
soggy O
salad B
and O
50 O
minute O
wait B
time O
with O
an O
incredibly O
rude O
service B
to O
deliver O
below O
average O
food B

- O
i O
asked O
for O
them O
spicy O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O

It O
is O
terrific O
as O
is O
the O
value O

The O
sicilian B
is O
my O
favorite O
it O
is O
moist O
not O
dry O
like O
most O
places O
but O
all O
their O
pizza B
is O
great O

Downstairs B
lounge I
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

The O
menu B
prices I
are O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
in O
quality B
and O
portion B
size I

The O
food B
was O
amazing O
and O
the O
service B
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
but O
not O
over-bearing O
or O
rushed O

food B
was O
delivered O
by O
a O
busboy B
not O
waiter B
We O
got O
no O
cheese B
offered O
for O
the O
pasta B
our O
water B
and I
wine B
glasses O
remained O
EMPTY O
our O
entire O
meal B
when O
we O
would O
have O
easily O
spent O
another O
$20 O
on O
wine B

The O
takeout B
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O

The O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
the O
sauces B
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O

Off O
the O
beaten O
path O
this O
jewel O
of O
a O
restaurant O
shines O
just O
one O
block O
away O
from O
the O
plethora O
of O
6th O
street O
Indian O
restaurants O

Could O
be O
pricey O
without O
a O
prix B
fixe I
meal I

This O
is O
definitely O
an O
 excellent O
date O
spot B
because O
of O
the O
ambiance B
and O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O
 night B
scene I
is O
more O
than O
alive O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B
- O
that's O
it O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O

Again O
the O
waitress B
was O
awesome O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it-especially O
the O
shows B
and O
actors B

The O
service B
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B
sauce I
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals B

The O
food B
was O
just O
OK O
I O
would O
never O
go O
back O

Zero O
ambiance B
to O
boot O

Got O
a O
little O
loud O
after O
8pm O
when O
the O
joint O
got O
full O

Scalina O
Fedeli O
reminded O
me O
why O
service B
is O
so O
integral O
to O
fine O
dining B

i O
recommend O
the O
thai B
popcorn I
: O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
the O
nex O
time O

Everything O
looks O
great O
the O
drinks B
the O
decor B
the O
food B
even O
the O
people O

As O
soon O
as O
my O
father O
lifted O
his O
pen O
from O
the O
check B
a O
chef B
appeared O
to O
usher O
us O
out O

The O
parathas B
and O
kebabs B
are O
made O
when O
ordered O
ensuring O
a O
level O
of O
freshness O
that O
is O
unsurpassed O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint O

The O
tuna B
and O
wasabe B
potatoes I
are O
excellent O

The O
only O
disappointment O
was O
the O
coat B
check I
girls I
who O
didn't O
seem O
to O
know O
what O
a O

I O
couldn't O
believe O
the O

Ummmthe O

cold O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O

to O
VT's O

It O

sometimes O
a O
little O
cramped O
and O

get O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
hello O

a O
hip O
japanese O
vibe B

Even O
with O
the O
prix B
fixe I
pricing I
this O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
it O

We O
asked O
to O
be O
moved O
which O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
then O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
high O
traffic O
area B
in O
the O
back O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
room B
was O
practically O
empty O

Good O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
the O
owners B
have O
some O
imagination O
and O
they O
have O
actually O
pulled O
it O
off O
like O
in O
this O
case O

However O
their O
popularity O
has O
yet O
to O
slow O
down O
and O
I O
still O
find O
myself O
drawn O
to O
their O
ambiance B
and O
delectable O
reputation O

Where O
tanks B
in O
other O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
display O
a O
lurking O
myriad O
of O
sad-looking O
marine O
life O
in O
their O
murky O
waters O
the O
tanks B
at O
Ping's O
are O
clear O
as O
glass O
with O
healthy-looking O
creatures O
who O
do O
not O
yet O
know O
that O
they O
will O
be O
part O
of O
some O
dim B
sum I
lover's O
brunch B

The O
Halibut B
was O
too O
salty O
dessert B
was O
so O
so O
don't O
waste O
any O
of O
your O
calories O
and O
service B
was O
poor O

The O
view B
is O
spectacular O
and O
the O
food B
is O
great O

The O
place B
wasn't O
too O
hard O
to O
find O
but O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
packed O
as O
soon O
as O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
got O
our O
food B
the O
line O
reached O
the O
door O

Good O
bagels B
and O
good O
cream B
cheese I

The O
food B
is O
wonderful O
tasty O
and O
filling O
and O
the O
service B
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced B

Always O
great O
service B

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B
was O
awsome O

I O
have O
been O
in O
many O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
and O
Roth's O
Steakhouse O
has O
quickly O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B
casserole I
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken B
all I
dark O
meat B
and O
on O
the O
bone O

A O
bit O
breezy O
up O
there O
on O
the O
mezzanine B
from O
the O
wind O
coming O
from O
the O
tracks O

I O
went O
to O
DF O
for O
Valentines B
Day I
dinner I

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B
fish I
drunken B
chicken I
and O
the O
soupy B
dumplings I
certainly O
the O
stir B
fry I
blue I
crab I

I O
LOVED O
THE O
SHOWS B

and O
i O
have O
been O
around O
the O
block O
to O
say O
the O
very O
least O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal B
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B
from O
the O
dumpling B
menu I

The O
aesthetics B
of O
this O
place B
are O
like O
an O
airport O
lounge O

Then O
get O
ripped O
on O
free O
box B
wine I

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B

If O
you O
don't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B
unfriendly O
staff B
and O
a O
sushi B
chef I
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O

The O
food B
itself O
was O
just O
ok O
- O
nothing O
spectacular O
- O
but O
the O
service B
was O
awful O

The O
pizza B
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B

As O
there O
were O
so O
many O
to O
choose O
from O
we O
wandered O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
looking O
in O
the O
windows O
and O
such O
noticicing O
many O
empty O
seats B
except O
at O
Taj O
Mahal O

Also O
don't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll B
if O
it's O
not O
on O
the O
menu B
you O
can't O
have O
it O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O

Good O
food B

and O
that's O
saying O
a O
lot O

those O
rolls B
were O
big O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B
wasn't O
fresh O

The O
pesto B
pizza I
was O
excellent O
thin-crust B
pizza I
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy O
Italian B
cheese I
that O
I'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
could O
get O
attention O
from O
was O
one O
of O
at O
least O
two O
cats O
running O
around O
that O
kept O
batting O
at O
my O
table O

if O
your O
into O
thaiyou O
cannot O
miss O
this O
great O
restaurant O

Going O
to O
Ballato's O
is O
like O
coming O
home O
and O
eating O
in O
my O
own O
kitchen O
an O
absolute O
delight O

try O
the O
spicy O
shrimp B
appetizer I
again O
not O
the O
greatest O
value O
in O
the O
world O
but O
worth O
the O
price B
and O
the O
lamb B
vindaloo I
is O
great O

However O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B
and O
consider O
the O
food B
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O

I O
think O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
more O
underrated O
places O
in O
the O
city O

for O
out-of-towners O
who O
will O
get O
a O
big O
thrill O
out O
of O
the O
location O

Everyone O
that O
has O
ever O
come O
here O
with O
me O
has O
become O
a O
convert O
and O
returned O
regularly O
with O
their O
own O
friends O

Food B
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B
or O
another O
visit O

I O
go O
at O
least O
3 O
times O
a O
month O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O

I O
think O
the O
restaurant O
was O
too O
loud O
when O
full O
to O
be O
romantic O

I O
have O
had O
so O
many O
dinners B
here O
and O
it's O
always O
been O
perfect O
- O
on O
a O
date O
with O
my O
husband O
with O
my O
mom O
with O
girlfriends O
and O
larger O
groups O

When O
you O
want O
a O
piece O
of O
beef B
head O
on O
over O

Delicate O
spices B
onions B
eggs B
and O
a O
kick-ass O
roti B

Incredible O
food B
at O
a O
very O
agreable O
price B
brings O
me O
back O
just O
about O
every O
other O
day O
to O
this O
authentic O
Thai O
restaurant O

I O
actually O
gave O
Patroon O
another O
chance O
before O
writing O
this O
but O
the O
second O
visit O
was O
even O
worse O

Also O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
certain O
table B
you O
don't O
have O
to O

Unbelievable O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O

I've O
been O
living O
in O
the O
Columbia O
University O
area O
for O
about O
10 O
years O
with O
3 O
kids O
- O
now O
in O
their O
teens O

The O
menu B
has O
lots O
of O
options: O
I O
hope O
to O
go O
back O
to O
try O
those O
potato B
pancakes I

As O
soon O
as O
I O
wake O
up O
on O
a O
saturday O
or O
sunday O
it O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
on O
my O
mind O
is O
when O
and O
how O
I O
will O
be O
getting O
to O
fried B
dumpling I

The O
staff B
isn't O
the O
friendliest O
or O
most O
competent O
and O
I O
am O
stickler O
for O
service B
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
place O
makes O
up O
for O
it O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
will O
usually O
only O
order O
one O
primi B
and O
one O
secondi B
and O
split O
them O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
offer O
large O
portions B

This O
restaurant O
was O
way O
overhyped O

I've O
overheard O
comments O
from O
him O
to O
his O
employees B
that O
should O
not O
have O
been O
delivered O
in O
the O
dining B
area I
and O
I've O
been O
sitting O
there O
while O
he O
lectured O
another O
customer O

Delicious O
crab B
cakes I
too O

Now O
at O
the O
top O
of O
our O
list O
Del O
Frisco's O
Steakhouse O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
dining B
experience I
I've O
ever O
had O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B
and O
the O
great O
staff B
at O
La O
Lanterna O

Just O
bring O
someone O
who O
speaks O
Cantonese O
because O
waiter B
may O
not O
understand O
you O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O

Not O
someplace O
I O
would O
seek O
to O
try O
out O
but O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
area O
again O
I O
will O
certainly O
stop O
by O

The O
bruschetta B
and O
panini's O
are O
so O
yummy O

Food B
was O
okay O
nothing O
great O

Every O
waitress B
and O
customer O
who O
passed O
by O
me O
bumped O
into O
my O
chair O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can't O
get O
enough O

Always O
popular O
always O
full O
always O
a O
wait B

In O
fact O
you O
can't O
miss O
it O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O

It O
is O
run O
by O
the O
same O
Sichuan B
chef I
who O
started O
the O
chain O
in O
Chinatown O

Get O
the O
feeling O
they O
settled O
into O
a O
groove O
a O
while O
ago O

If O
the O
omakase O
is O
to O
showcase O
technique O
and O
variety O
serving B
almost O
40% O
of O
items O
BBQ-ed O
and O
a O
spicy B
tuna I
roll I
wrapped O
with O
not-so-fresh O
nori B
seems O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
limp O
performance O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B

Best O
Pastrami B
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B
without O
being O
ridiculous O

If O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
appreciates O
the O
same O
things O
but O
hope O
to O
have O
food B
to O
spare O
or O
share O
Kai O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
option O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B

I O
don't O
get O
it O
what's O
so O
special O
about O
Prune O
 
I'd O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
little O
place O

Again O
if O
you O
are O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
- O
by O
all O
means O
come O
here O

The O
first O
2 O
courses B
were O
very O
good O
but O
the O
chocolate B
sampler I
was O
too O
rich O
for O
me O
and O
the O
dessert B
wine I
far O
too O
sweet O

Butter B
was O
melted O
white B
wine I
warm O
cheese B
oozing O
everywhere O

We O
had O
a O
party O
in O
their O
private B
room I
and O
they O
made O
it O
truly O
memorable O
and O
were O
very O
helpful O
in O
the O
planning O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
walk O
the O
extra O
avenue O
from O
joe's O
to O
eat O
here O

It O
cannot O
be O
the O
ambience B
because O
the O
place B
is O
very O
cramped O
and O
some O
guests O
have O
to O
sit O
in O
an O
aisle B

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Shabu O
Tatsu O
at O
least O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
always O
want O
to O
go O
back O
for O
more O

We O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
pre-fixe B
menu I
of O
only O
2 O
choices B
per I
course I
other O
restaurants O
offer O
3 O
choices B
and I
ended I
up O
ordering B
a I
la I
carte I

Authentic O
Pakistani B
food I

The O
staff B
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
and O
the O
chef B
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O

Get O
it O
together O

The O
eggplant B
parmesan I
is O
also O
great O
and O
my O
friend O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
Manhattan O
claims O
that O
no O
one O
serves B
a O
better O
baked B
ziti I
with I
meatsauce I

Quality O
ingredients B
preparation O
all O
around O
and O
a O
very O
fair O
price B
for O
NYC O

Service B
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
attentive O
and O
non-intrusive O

My O
entree B
of O
hot B
pot I
with I
seafood I
was O
full O
of O
imitation O
crabmeat B
with O
a O
couple O
pieces O
of O
shrimp B
and O
squid B
and O
was O
unnecessarily O
heated O
with O
a O
burner O

We O
began O
with O
the O
cheese B
fondue I
the O
artisanal O
blend O
and O
added O
apples B
and O
kielbasa B
to O
dip O

In O
such O
a O
crappy O
part O
of O
town O
to O
find O
a O
good O
value B
for O
lunch B
this O
place O
is O
great O

Its O
not O
curry B
in O
a O
slurry O
crap O
and O
regular O
run O
of O
the O
mill O
food B

In O
fact O
while O
leaving O
the O
place O
we O
saw O
two O
people O
looking O
at O
the O
menu B
and O
I O
couldn't O
help O
telling O
them O
that O
the O
food B
was O
horrible O

Even O
though O
the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
we O
were O
seated B
promptly O
and O
even O
asked O
for O
a O
table B
upstairs O
with O
no O
problems O

If O
you O
want O
Americanized O
Chinese B
food I
with O
your O
usual O
watery O
generic O
white B
sauce I
this O
is O
your O
place O

The O
bread B
is O
the O
soft O
paratha B
bread B
unlike O
the O
plain O
bread B
they O
use O
in O
Calcutta O
and O
the O
stuffing B
is O
tandoori B
styled O
and O
very O
flavorful O

Service B
is O
friendly O
prices B
are O
good O
- O
delivery B
time I
was O
a O
little O
slow O
but O
for O
the O
way O
this O
pizza B
tastes O
I'm O
willing O
to O
overlook O
it O

The O
food B
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe O
fixe O
tasting O
menu O
is O
the O
greatest O
food B
for O
a O
good O
price B
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food B
to O
any O
food B
allergies O
or O
food B
you O
don't O
like O

The O
service B
is O
excellent O
the O
decor B
is O
great O
and O
the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
- O
the O
Hoboken O
health O
inspector O
clued O
me O
to O
his O
findings O
that O
this O
is O
THE O
cleanest O
restaurant O
in O
town O

An O
excellent O
service B

The O
food B
however O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B
noodles I
with I
shrimp I
and I
chicken I
and I
coconut I
juice I
is O
the O
MUST O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars O

The O
pizza B
was O
really O
good O

The O
only O
possible O
drawback O
to O
this O
last O
point O
is O
that O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
this O
posting O
the O
additional O
menu B
items I
are O
only O
written O
in O
Chinese O

Food B
is O
average O
and O
I O
would O
say O
even O
the O
chain O
restaurant O
Baluchi's O
tastes O
better O

The O
place B
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B
is O
fantastic O

The O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B
sizes I
are O
appropriate O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O

Enjoy O

Kosher B
dills I
are O
the O
perfect O
compliment O
for O
your O
unforgetable O
sandwich B
and O
they O
give O
you O
plenty O
of O
them O

Kudos O
to O
Po O

The O
entertainment B
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows B
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner B

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
were O
in O
NY O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
Pastis O
was O
a O
place O
that O
came O
recommended O

The O
food B
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
nice O

The O
food B
there O
is O
so O
good O
that O
even O
to O
order O
out O
the O
wait B
is O
incredible O

The O
bartender B
on O
my O
most O
recent O
visit O
was O
so O
incredibly O
rude O
that O
I O
will O
never O
go O
back O

Their O
sushi B
Kamikaze B
and O
other O
Rolls B
are O
fresh O
and O
well O
presented O

For O
authentic O
Thai B
food I
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O

It's O
true O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
in O
a O
scene O
from O
Goodfellas O

I O
read O
the O
other O
review O
and O
have O
to O
say O
I O
had O
the O
opposite O
experience O
here O
last O
Sunday O

The O
highlight O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
mayonaisse B
for O
my O
side O
of O
fries B
I O
received O
from O
one O
of O
the O
food B
runners I
which O
is O
not O
good O
considering O
the O
bill B
was O
nearly O
$100 O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special B
the O
braised B
lamb I
shank I
in I
red I
wine I
which O
was O
excellent O

If O
anyones O
has O
doubt O
of O
not O
knowing O
enough O
about O
winesplease O
check O
their O
wine B
list I

Never O
again O

The O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all-business O
waitstaff B
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food B
down O
rushing O
you O
out O

Have O
the O
iced B
tea I

For O
Park O
avenue O
I O
expected O
so O
much O
more O

Small O
servings B
for O
main O
entree B
i O
had O
salmon B
wasnt O
impressed O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B
it O
was O
good O

So O
rude O

you O
can O
actually O
get O
2 O
salads B
worth O
if O
u O
take O
it O
home O
and O
add O
it O
to O
some O
lettuce B

The O
ambience B
is O
very O
romantic O
and O
definitely O
a O
good O
place B
to O
bring O
a O
date O

They O
are O
FAST O

It O
is O
far O
more O
popular O
as O
a O
bar B
than O
as O
a O
restaurant O
with O
only O
a O
few O
tables B
and O
the O
waiter B
being O
the O
bartender B
but O
we O
greatly O
enjoyed O
the O
unobtrusive O
atmosphere B

The O
food B
is O
very O
good O
for O
it's O
price B
better O
than O
most O
fried B
dumplings I
I've O
had O

There O
are O
much O
better O
places O
in O
NY O
with O
better O
prices B

Very O
neighborhoody O
very O
quick O
and O
sufficient O

Obv B
caviar I
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B
is O
so O
diverse O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
taste O
so O
manydifferent O
varietys O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O

Everything O
is O
delicious O
though O
my O
gf O
and O
I O
come O
here O
once O
a O
week O
sometimes- O
you O
will O
get O
addicted O

And O
I O
could O
do O
without O
the O
cigar O
smoke O

Still O
try O
it O
once O
since O
if O
you O
end O
up O
loving O
the O
food B
it O
could O
be O
one O
of O
your O
best O
dining B
experiences I

I've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food B

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B
santa B
fe I
chopped I
salad I
and O
fish B
and I
chips I

The O
ambience B
is O
very O
calm O
and O
quiet O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O

Great O
deal O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
latter O
since O
you O
won't O
go O
for O
seconds O
hint O
hint O

not O
only O
does O
make O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
NY O
 maybe O
anywhere O

The O
spicy O
Tuna B
roll I
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I've O
had O
at O
this O
price B
range I

Price B
and O
quality B
of O
fish B
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O

Our O
waiter B
and O
all O
of O
the O
people O
helping O
him O
were O
attentive O
and O
genuine O

The O
place B
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means: O
simple O
dishes B
and O
wine B
served B
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort B
food I
places O
in O
the O
city O

Overall O
the O
ingredients B
and O
technique B
are O
there O
and O
I O
am O
encouraged O
enough O
to O
return O
at O
lunch B
or O
dinner B
to O
see O
whether O
the O
boldness O
of O
the O
flavour O
palette O
improves O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B
sandwich I
on O
a O
roll O

Though O
you O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table B
with O
what O
seems O
like O
barely O
enough O
room B
no O
matter O
what O
the O
size O
of O
your O
party O
the O
warm O
atomosphere B
is O
worth O
the O
cramped O
quarters- O
you'll O
have O
fun O
and O
forgot O
about O
the O
tight O
spot B
you're O
in O

The O
fish B
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O

Considering O
their O
price B
of O
$625 O
for O
lunch B
special I
the O
dish B
was O
ridiculously O
small O

This O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
Indian B
Fast I
Food I
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O

Besides O
when O
you O
have O
bad O
service B
that's O
less O
money B
you O
have O
to O
tip B

We O
do O
not O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
four-star O
restaurant O
anymore O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
also O
really O
nice O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O

Service B
was O
devine O
oysters B
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
and O
the O
price B
can't O
be O
beat O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel B

Ballato's O
is O
consistently O
delicious O
authentic O
italian B
food I

The O
service B
was O
attentive O
yet O
discreet O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky O
Strike O
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid-back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O

For O
those O
prices B
and O
the O
dressed O
up O
atmosphere B
you O
expect O
more O
and O
should O
get O
more O

Then O
IF O
they O
answer O
the O
phone O
you're O
lucky O
if O
they O
don't O
hang O
up O
on O
you O

They O
offer O
the O
same O
menu B
but O
have O
creative O
drinks B
that O
are O
loaded O
with O
alcohol O
and O
cheeky O
names O
-- O
but O
they O
do O
cost O
you O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
restaurant O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
fun O
atmosphere B
and O
good O
food B

The O
food B
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O

highly O
recommended O

Unless O
you O
are O
eating O
in O
the O
Pizzeria O
side O
of O
this O
place B
and O
are O
not O
in O
a O
rush O
this O
place B
is O
a O
bad O
idea O

You O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service B
a O
lot O

Ambiance B
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management B
tries O

I O
must O
warn O
the O
reader O
that O
the O
portions B
sizes O
are O
very O
small O
especially O
the O
appetizers B
so O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
eat O
until O
you O
are O
full O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
order O
the O
chef's O
special O
tasting O
menu B
prepare O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
for O
an O
appetizer B
1 O
dish B
for O
each O
person O
because O
the O
portions B
are O
not O
for O
sharing O
a O
main B
entree I
and O
the O
cold B
udon I
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food B
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice B

After O
we O
got O
our O
sashimi B
order O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
small O
the O
portions B
were O

After O
the O
main B
course I
came O
we O
didn't O
see O
our O
waiter B
for O
at O
least O
40 O
MINUTES O

It O
will O
be O
on O
my O
to O
do O
list O
the O
next O
visit O
to O
NYC O

Nothing O
better O
than O
buying O
a O
snapple B
for O
$325 O
too O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps B
to O
test O
their O
palets O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O

Service B
is O
extraordinary O
yet O
not O
overbearing O
and O
the O
decor B
brings O
a O
taste O
of O
trendy O
SoHo O
into O
Queens O

The O
dosas B
are O
skimpy O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
and O
personally O
I'd O
drink O
popcorn B
topping I
before O
I'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O

The O
service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene B
and O
annoying O
customers B
I'd O
go O
out O
in O
Manhattan O

After O
a O
seafood B
craving O
i O
checked O
citysearch O
and O
chose O
to O
go O
to O
Fish O
based O
on O
a O
previous O
review O
and O
the O
citysearch O
info O

Right O
off O
the O
major O
deegan O
you O
get O
ladies B
from O
all O
over O
the O
city O

Until O
you O
realize O
that O
their O
five O
minutes O
is O
meaningless O
and O
your O
wait B
may O
be O
anywhere O
from O
two O
to O
twenty O
minutes O
it O
may O
be O
frustrating O

always O
fresh O
and O
delicious O

The O
food B
was O
very O
good O
but O
not O
very O
thai O

Thalia O
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B
serving I
you O
but O
the O
food B
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up O

The O
fillings B
may O
be O
unconventional O
but O
the O
dosa B
batter I
is O
definitely O
authentic O
and O
the O
combinations O
very O
tasty O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B
for O
meeting O
friends O
having O
lunch B
dinner B
pre-theatre B
or I
after-theatre I
drinks I

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant O
to O
go O
to O

The O
mussaman B
curry I
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
as O
thin O
as O
water O
and O
aside O
from O
the O
poorly O
fried B
tofu I
that O
I O
ordered O
in O
it O
they O
graciously O
provided O
me O
with O
ONE O
piece O
of O
poorly O
cooked O
potato B

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner B
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B
with O
great O
service B
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B

Their O
sake B
martini I
is O
wonderful O

Well O
this O
place B
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O

Bravissimo O
 
Once O
they O
ran O
out O
of O
Gnochi B
and O
made O
it O
for O
me O
from O
scratch O

We O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
Marcelo O
and O
Grace O
for O
a O
wonderful O
dining B
experience O

Found O
service B
above O
average O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O

When O
I O
arrived O
at O
Orsay O
I O
was O
thrown O
back O
in O
a O
veyr O
good O
sense O

Bagels B
are O
ok O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O

This O
is O
the O
Cheers O
of O
New O
York O
whether O
you've O
ever O
been O
there O
or O
not O

It's O
to O
die O
for O

Cute O
and O
decorative O

I O
know O
this O
is O
the O
case O
in O
many O
nyc O
eateries O
but O
here O
they O
really O
cram O
you O
in O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it's O
borderline O
uncomfortable O

fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality B

Overall O
a O
disappointing O
experience O
for O
that O
price B
category O

I've O
had O
the O
lunch B
buffet I
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

The O
food B
was O
exceptional O

You O
will O
be O
satisfied O

Another O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out-of-towners O

But O
hey O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
with O
a O
decent O
vegetarian O
selection O
in O
Astoria O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O

A O
Thai O
restaurant O
out O
of O
rice B
during O
dinner B

but O
still O
my O
date O
was O
bad O

Would O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao's O
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O

The O
portions B
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O

and O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
Which O
impresses O
me O
for O
having O
such O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
people O
to O
serve B

Sure O
the O
setting B
is O
nice O

Overall O
a O
worthwhile O
experience O

The O
service B
is O
friendly O
if O
not O
the O
most O
prompt O
in O
the O
world O
the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
prices B
while O
not O
cheap O
won't O
put O
your O
wallet O
out O
of O
commission O

Had O
1 O
appetizer B
2 O
entrees B
and O
2 O
cokes B
and O
the O
bill B
was O
~$5500 O
not O
including O
tip O

It's O
really O
a O
takeaway O
place O
I O
wouldn't O
sit O
if O
I O
could O
take O
it O
home O

THE O
MOST O
FUN O
RESTAURANT O
I O
HAVE O
EVER O
BEEN O
TOO O

Best O
drumsticks B
over I
rice I
and O
sour B
spicy I
soup I
in O
town O

Some O
of O
the O
finest O
latin O
women O
you'll O
see O
in O
your O
life O
hang O
out O
at O
Jimmy's O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B
start O
at O
$70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$30+ O

Their O
whitefish B
salad I
is O
excellent--all O
whitefish B
with I
a O
little O
mayo B

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price B
congee B
noodles B
and O
rice B
dishes I
are O
no O
more O
than O
$3-6 O
each O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O

The O
chicken B
parm I
was O
edible O
but O
had O
canned O
tomato B
sauce B
and O
boxed O
pasta B
and O
the O
chicken B
with I
portobello O
mushrooms O
consisted O
of O
dry O
inedible O
chicken B
with I
terrible O
sauce B

I O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
who O
asks O
me O
where O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
meal B

The O
waitresses B
are O
nice--also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B
service I
sit O

The O
only O
friendly O
staff B
member I
was O
the O
guy B
at O
the O
bar B

Having O
been O
a O
long O
time O
Ess-a-Bagel O
fan O
I O
was O
surpised O
to O
find O
myself O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again O
to O
Murray's O

Go O
for O
it O

Highly O
recommended O

You O
can O
certainly O
find O
restaurants O
that O
offer O
a O
superior O
fine O
dining O
experience O
but O
for O
superb O
food B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
La O
Villa O
can't O
be O
beat O

Won't O
or O
Can't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service B
directory O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O

I O
do O
suggest O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
seated O
upstairs B
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
be O
a O
little O
cozy O

To O
speak O
of O
the O
Park O
Side O
words O
can O
not O
describe O

The O
red B
curry I
is O
weak O
and O
tasteless O
the O
pad B
thai I
is O
stuck O
together O
and O
lumpy O
the O
rice B
is O
often O
overcooked O
and O
the O
seafood B
is O
pretty O
sketchy O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced B
meal B

Saul B
is O
pretty O
good O
but O
definitely O
not O
great O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy's O
for O
that O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B

We O
always O
get O
a O
sampling O
of O
appetizers B
and O
share O

Overall O
I O
was O
impressed O
and O
will O
return O
it's O
a O
great O
QPR O
Quality B
to O
Price B
Ratio O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table B
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner B
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O

Their O
pad B
penang I
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O

The O
puke O
green O
walls B
leave O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
but O
the O
food B
is O
very O
good O

The O
flavors B
are O
very O
fresh O
and O
pretty O
inobtrusive O
nothing O
flashy O

I O
like O
Cafe O
Noir O
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O

The O
hanger B
steak I
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O

But O
$1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece O

Our O
son O
loves O
pizza B
and O
we O
have O
a O
certified O
Neapolitan O
pizzaria O
in O
our O
home O
city O
Seattle O
we O
liked O
this O
nearly O
as O
much O
- O
and O
the O
differences O
were O
more O
about O
personal O
preference O
than O
any O
reflection O
on O
either O
restaurant O

big O
and O
soft O
as O
well O
as O
good O
lunch B
food I

No O
food B
snobs O
allowed O
this O
place O
is O
for O
people O
who O
appreciate O
good O
food B

I O
liked O
the O
food B
at O
this O
quasi-thai B
restaurant O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast B
food I
restaurant O

Suan O
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
classmates O
too O

Not O
a O
great O
place O
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O

As O
for O
the O
bar B
this O
is O
another O
bad O
idea O

Their O
bagels B
are O
fine O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special' O
bagel B
experience O

Unlike O
HH O
up O
the O
block O
this O
place O
actually O
gives O
you O
hearty O
and O
hot O
bagels B
this O
town O
is O
known O
for O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O

The O
barebecued B
salmon I
is O
elegantly O
spiced O
and O
not O
at O
all O
dry O

Same O
owner B
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O

What O
generous O
portions B

The O
workers B
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B
with O
cream B
cheese I
gets O
a O
little O
messy O

I O
was O
wrong O

The O
wine B
the O
service B
was O
very O
good O
too O

So O
the O
menu B
is O
written O
in O
chalk O
above O
your O
head O
and O
it O
all O
sounds O
delicious O

The O
highly O
spiced O
chai B
tea I
was O
great O
too O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O

I O
have O
been O
there O
many O
times O
and O
food B
is O
good O
and O
consistent O

Seriously O
this O
is O
the O
best O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
in O
town- O
As O
everyone O
says O
the O
Spicy B
Tuna I
hand I
rolls I
are O
the O
best- O
have O
4 O
of O
these O
and O
you've O
broken O
even O

There O
is O
not O
a O
single O
place O
in O
Chinatown O
where O
you O
have O
a O
nice O
neighborhood O
feeling O
like O
here O

While O
Sapphire O
is O
certainly O
not O
lacking O
in O
ambiance B
and O
probably O
has O
the O
best O
decor B
of O
any O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
have O
been O
to O
in O
New O
York O
City O
the O
food B
was O
not O
what O
I O
had O
hoped O
for O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
atmosphere B
that O
whisks O
you O
away O
to O
the O
left O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
Seine O

I O
just O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
the O
fuss O
is O
all O
about O

The O
meat B
dishes I
were O
only O
so-so O

His O
wife O
Tanya O
the O
hostess B
completes O
the O
comforting O
atmosphere B
by O
being O
delightfully O
warm O
and O
gracious O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O

The O
menu B
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere B
food I
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O

I O
have O
been O
a O
longtime O
fan O
of O
Holy O
Basil O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
and O
while O
I O
do O
believe O
their O
food B
has O
slightly O
slipped O
in O
quality B
I O
have O
been O
hesitant O
to O
be O
disloyal O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late O
night O
atmosphere B
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O

For O
an O
untrendy O
rip-off- O
eat O
here O

And O
you're O
hungry O
a O
few O
hours O
later O

I O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O

I O
HATE O
HATE O
HATE O
this O
place O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O

The O
staff B
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O

You O
don't O
go O
to O
Mizu O
for O
excellent O
service B
you O
go O
for O
the O
large O
amounts O
of O
food B
the O
amiable O
atmosphere B
and O
the O
hole-in-the-wall O
feeling O
of O
the O
place O

The O
service B
is O
always O
bad O
though O
don't O
expect O
much O
of O
anything O
from O
your O
server B
and O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
bringing O
a O
date O
here O
either O

Monday O
nights O
are O
a O
bargain O
at O
the O
$28 O
prix B
fix I
- O
this O
includes O
a O
three B
course B
meal O
plus O
*three* O
glasses B
of I
wine I
paired O
with O
each O
course B

Wonderful O

It O
took O
them O
15 O
minutes O
to O
put O
water B
in O
our O
glasses O

The O
service B
is O
descent O
even O
when O
this O
small O
place B
is O
packed O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza B
here O

This O
place O
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O

Great O
value O
for O
the O
quality O
ingredients B

The O
Thali B
was O
small O
thoroughly O
unremarkable O
and O
$1495 O

The O
sushi B
is O
also O
great O

From O
the O
complimentary O
chef B
app I
of O
a O
delicate B
butternut I
squash I
ravioli I
in I
a I
delicious I
truffle I
sauce I
to O
an O
amazing O
buttery B
and I
tender I
langostine I
entree I
to O
a O
dessert B
that O
I O
can't O
remember O
because O
of O
the O
fabulous O
Cakebread B
Cabernet I
we O
were O
drinking O
-- O
the O
whole O
evening O
was O
amazing O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B

The O
food B
here O
is O
rather O
good O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B

The O
staff B
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
they're O
fast O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar B
and O
fix O
drinks B
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu B
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O

The O
makhani B
was O
OK O
--the O
korma B
was O
bland O

The O
food B
is O
inventive O
but O
still O
keeps O
traditional O
indian O
flavoring O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
WOW O

though O
the O
service B
could O
be O
better O
possibly O
due O
to O
more O
than O
one O
very O
large O
group O
in O
the O
house O
it O
is O
very O
cordial O
and O
warm O
as O
is O
the O
general O
clientele O

The O
decor B
in O
this O
place B
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place B
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
just O
simple O
small O
and O
sparse O

This O
is O
a O
cute O
place B
and O
could O
be O
good O
but O
they O
need O
to O
get O
their O
act O
together O

The O
lox B
is O
always O
fresh O
too O

Sure O
enough O
exactly O
30 O
minutes O
later O
we O
got O
the O
call O
and O
were O
seated O
promptly O

Service B
was O
very O
friendly O

So O
all O
I'm O
trying O
to O
say O
is O
this O
restaurant O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
thai B
food I
restaurant O
I've O
ever O
been O
to O

Food B
was O
OK O
- O
fish B
was O
cooked O
well O

We O
actually O
left O
hungry O
and O
went O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Wo O
Hop O
at O
15 O
Mott O
street O
for O
some O
good O
chinese B
food I

The O
duck B
confit I
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B
gras I
terrine I
with I
figs I
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe O
Noir O
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O

The O
service B
does O
sometimes O
lack O
focus O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ideal O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
but O
I O
have O
never O
been O
treated O
rudely O

I O
have O
reservations B
about O
the O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
deal O
however O
-- O
the O
choices B
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food B
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu B

The O
staff B
offers O
impeccable O
service B

The O
catch O
is O
that O
you O
are O
charged O
extra O
for O
ANYTHING O
that O
you O
leave O
on O
your O
plate O
so O
don't O
be O
a O
greedy O
pig O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B
Jamun I
dessert I
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter B

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O

This O
place O
doesn't O
compare O
with O
Mamoun's O
in O
terms O
of O
price B
freshness B
value B
and O
consisent O
quality B
but O
that's O
just O
my O
opinion O

The O
place B
is O
sleek O
modern O
and O
playfull O
and O
i O
will O
return O
again O
frequently O

I O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
13 O
years O
Emiliothe O
Godfather O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B
and O
wine B
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices B

The O
brioche B
and I
lollies I
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal B

After O
being O
told O
that O
our O
party O
of O
three O
would O
be O
seated O
in O
10 O
minutes O
and O
watching O
other O
parties O
multiples O
of O
2 O
and O
higher O
seated O
for O
40 O
minutes O
the O
three O
of O
us O
were O
squished O
into O
a O
small O
2-person B
table I

And O
the O
bill B
was O
outragous O

The O
service B
was O
attentive O
yet O
unimposing O
the O
food B
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced B

Kind O
attentive O
wait B
staff I

Bon O
appettite O

Salads B
were O
fantastic O

The O
owners B
and O
employees B
are O
friendly O
and O
their O
pizza B
is O
fantastic O

La O
Rosa O
waltzes O
in O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O

The O
food B
is O
yummy O
especially O
their O
cooked-to-perfection O
mussels B
in I
spicy I
tomato I
sauce I
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B

The O
food B
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O

A O
great O
addition O
to O
Smith O
Street: O
finally O
a O
place O
that's O
not O
pretentious O
and O
filled O
with O
women O
wearing O
Ugg O
boots O

skip O
dessert B

We O
spent O
$200 O
in O
this O
place O
and O
left O
hungry O
and O
very O
disappointed O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel B
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O

It O
was O
like O
the O
servers B
forgot O
that O
they O
actually O
worked O
there O
and O
instead O
wanted O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
be O
cool O

I O
liked O
this O
place O
the O
first O
time O
but O
doubt O
I O
will O
ever O
return O

The O
service B
is O
good O
and O
ambience B
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O

A O
great O
way O
to O
make O
some O
money O
is O
to O
buy O
a O
case B
of I
snapple I
from O
Costco O
and O
sell O
it O
right O
outside O
for O
only O
$250 O

It's O
all O
about O
the O
food B
 
Fast O
service B

Skip O
this O
restaurant O
it's O
a O
big O
disappointment O

The O
staff B
is O
excellent O
specjal: O
that O
girl O
behind O
the O
bar B
european O
chic O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B
beef B
and O
lamb B
dishes I

The O
service B
was O
bad O
the O
food B
took O
to O
forever O
to O
come O
we O
sat O
on O
the O
upper O
level O

We O
a O
menu O
that O
rearely O
changese O
xcept O
for O
one O
or O
two O
specials B
the O
quality B
and O
care B
they O
put O
in O
thier O
food B
in O
evident O

ALWAYS O
full O
with O
tourists O
especially O
because O
of O
it's O
close O
proximity O
to O
Rockefeller O
Center O

The O
decor B
is O
nice O
but O
more O
casual O
than O
fine O
dining O

This O
restaurant O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
to O
go O
many O
times O
and O
it O
is O
reasonably O
priced B

Bravo O
Blue O
Hill O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
came O
across O
this O
place O
while O
walking O
in O
the O
village O

Bottom O
line: O
B+ O
for O
the O
food B
F O
for O
the O
service B

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B
don't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O

This O
place O
is O
to O
be O
avoided O

Stick O
to O
dimsum B
not O
super O
overpriced O
noodles B

The O
service B
is O
fine O
and O
they O
allow O
you O
to O
enjoy O
the O
view B

My O
sister O
says O
it O
reminds O
her O
of O
a O
restaurant O
run O
by O
high-school O
students O
who O
don't O
know O
what O
they O
are O
doing O

We O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O

At O
6:30 O
we O
were O
the O
third O
party O
there O

delicious O
simple O
food B
in O
nice O
outdoor O
atmosphere B

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O

No O
really O

The O
food B
is O
good O
but O
very O
expensive O
for O
the O
casualness O
of O
it O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices B

I've O
been O
to O
Naples O
45 O
for O
dinner B
twice O

The O
hot O
and O
sour O
soup B
was O
unbearably O
hot O
and O
tasted O
of O
only O
pepper B
and O
nothing O
else O

i O
love O
the O
pics O
of O
andy O
warhol O
when O
he O
used O
to O
frequent O
the O
place O

painted O

Try O
sushimi B
cucumber I
roll I

I'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O

The O
food B
is O
delicious O

Their O
wines B
by I
the I
glass I
are O
a O
great O
accompaniment O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
like O
a O
king O
with O
wine B
for O
under O
$30 O

This O
place B
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O

Amma O
is O
nothing O
special O

Yeah O
Shanghai O
is O
also O
great O
but O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
-- O
they O
use O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
salt B
but O
without O
sweetness O
to O
balance O
out O

believe O
us O
we've O
been O
eating O
sushi B
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O

Worth O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
or O
any O
time O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
much O
better O
than O
Sripraphai O
more O
modern O
and O
sleek O

I O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
dress O
up O
and O
impress O
the O
lady O

The O
food B
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B
is O
quick O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O

The O
bagels B
always O
warm O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O

I O
had O
a O
late O
dinner B
at O
Lucky O
Stike O
a O
great O
name O
for O
a O
joint O
if O
ever O
I O
saw O
one O

Been O
there O
done O
that O
and O
New O
York O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O

Definitely O
a O
once O
a O
year O
treat O
that O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
around O
the O
holidays O

Service B
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O

from O
an O
English O
speaking O
staff B

Anyhow O
we O
were O
able O
to O
sit O
as O
long O
as O
we O
wanted O
and O
chat O
which O
was O
nice O

And O
they O
have O
these O
home O
made O
potato B
chips I
at O
the O
bar B
that O
are O
the O
most O
delicious O
things O
in O
the O
world O

A O
defitely O
must O
visit O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
each O
of O
the O
6 O
taste O
size O
portions B
and O
left O
completely O
full O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table B

We O
all O
ate O
pasta B
entre'es I
which O
were O
great O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
showed O
up O
on O
a O
Sat O

The O
steak B
was O
excellent O
and O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
had O
I O
tasted O
the O
butter B
intitally O
but O
in O
no O
way O
did O
it O
overwhelm O
the O
flavor B
of O
the O
meat B

great O
experience O
overall O

PERFECT O
FOR O
DATES O

The O
food B
was O
boring O
and O
expensive O

The O
ambience B
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch B
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O

Terrific O
menu B
full O
of O
unique O
rolls B
and O
special O
dishes B

The O
service B
is O
ok O
but O
could O
be O
better O

We O
love O
the O
food B
drinks B
and O
atmosphere B

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B
service I
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O

I've O
ordered O
from O
the O
2nd O
ave O

Nothing O
against O
a O
good O
sales O
call O
but O
the O
tactics O
at O
Amma O
are O
just O
too O
obvious O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O

up O

closing O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place B
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother's O
Day O
and O
the O
maitre B
d' I
was O
pretty O
rude O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
each O
time O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B
bar I
chef B
Yoshi O
and O
ordered O
everything O
ala B
carte I

The O
vibe B
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
service B
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside O
table B

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality B
cheap O
eats O
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O

However O
for O
what O
we O
spent O
overall O
it O
just O
was O
not O
up O
to O
par O

The O
service B
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
casual O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8:30 O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O

I O
recommend O
their O
Pad B
See I
Ew I
Pork B
Chops I
or O
Tofu B
plates I

Never O
in O
my O
life O
did O
I O
think O
that O
I O
could O
be O
satisfied O
both O
in O
taste B
and O
in O
quantity B
for O
$300 O
in O
NYC O

this O
is O
the O
best O
secret O
place O
in O
midtown' O
I O
heard O
that O
from O
the O
bartender B
after O
having O
brilliant O
food B
 try O
steak B
with I
portobello I
mushrooms I
and O
drinks B
on O
the O
bar B
last O
Tuesday O

The O
service B
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O

The O
main B
course I
had O
an O
average O
portion B
and O
was O
decent O
overall O

20 O
minutes O
for O
our O
reservation B
but O
it O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
have O
a O
few O
cocktails B
and O
enjoy O
our O
surroundings B
and O
each O
other O

Just O
remember O
the O
later O
you O
go O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O

Waitstaff B
is O
great O
very O
attentive O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O

The O
dinner B
menu I
is O
diverse O
and O
top-notch O
as O
well O

IT O
IS O
WHAT O
MODERN O
CUISINE B
IS O
ALL O
ABOUT O

In O
any O
event O
even O
though O
its O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
we O
still O
love O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

I O
definitely O
will O
go O
back O

I O
don't O
like O
Indian B
food I
too O
much O
and O
this O
was O
delicious O
however O
you O
want O
to O
factor O
that O
into O
the O
equation O

at O
taj O
vegetarians O
can O
rejoice-all O
the O
dishes B
are O
manna O
from O
heaven O

Finally O

Forget O
the O
rush B
and O
the O
wait B
and O
the O
noise B
which O
isn't O
actually O
that O
bad O
I O
mean O
please O
who O
goes O
to O
a O
steakhouse O
to O
be O
coddled O
and O
romantic O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
romantic O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O

I've O
never O
been O
disappointed O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill B

We O
live O
in O
New O
Jersey O
and O
whenever O
we O
go O
into O
New O
York O
City O
we O
buy O
bagels B
to O
eat O
hot O
and O
then O
to O
freeze O
they O
told O
me O
that O
if O
I O
call O
in O
the O
order O
they'd O
bring O
it O
out O
to O
the O
car O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
parking O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O

Jimmy's O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
hottest O
night O
spot B
in O
the O
Bronx O

And O
I O
would O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
masses O
in O
terms O
of O
service B
- O
delivery B
is O
their O
Achilles' O
heel O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
have O
been O
to O
The O
Minnow O
four O
times O
now O
and O
we O
have O
consistently O
been O
impressed O

The O
$300 O
bill B
was O
a O
bit O
steep O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
great O

I O
wouldn't O
mind O
going O
back O
some O
time O
but O
not O
before O
trying O
others O
nearby O

Nice O
ambiance B
nice O
little O
bar B
good O
bartender B
Francois O
and O
good O
service B

I O
found O
this O
restaurant O
to O
be O
one O
that O
truly O
values O
its O
patrons O

The O
calamari B
comes O
with O
an O
incredible O
sauce B
and O
the O
duck B
noodles I
are O
yummy O
as O
well O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
-- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B
on O
the O
blackboard O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
when O
we O
got O
in O
and O
remained O
so O
for O
the O
entire O
evening O
I O
don't O
understand O
why O
but O
we O
had O
a O
blast O
and O
will O
definately O
go O
back O
the O
next O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
area O

Simple O
comfort B
food I
and O
what O
hot O
and O
lage O
portions B

But O
I O
just O
would O
like O
to O
say O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
people O
left O
and O
thats O
why O
I O
checked O
it O
out O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
two O
specialty O
rolls B
on O
the O
menu B
though- O
too O
much O
avocado B
and O
rice B
will O
fill O
you O
up O
right O
quick O

I've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O

We O
didn't O
get O
drink B
refills I
and O
she O
didn't O
even O
offer O
us O
the O
option O
of O
dessert B

Beautiful O
experience O

The O
bagels B
are O
also O
reasonably O
priced B
for O
NYC O

If O
you O
can O
handle O
that O
it's O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
business B
dinner I
fun O
with O
friends O
or O
simply O
a O
table B
for O
2 O

Decor B
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican O

Also O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B
spicy- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don't O

Our O
waiter B
was O
fine O
the O
place B
looks O
nice O
in O
that O
not-trying-too-hard O
way O
but O
at O
those O
prices B
a O
little O
more O
should O
be O
expected O
of O
your O
food B

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings B

When O
my O
husband O
and O
go O
there O
we O
spend O
$6000 O
have O
LOBSTER B
TAILS I
UMMMMM O
need O
I O
say O
more O
I O
can't O
say O
any O
more O
it O
a O
place B
you'll O
never O
forget O
If O
you O
never O
go O
you'll O
miss O
A O
Meal B
of O
your O
life O
time O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
increase O
turnover O
the O
restaurant O
offers O
no O
desserts B
beyond O
the O
complimentary O
espresso B
cup I
filled I
with I
chocolate I
mousse I

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
times O
and O
when O
I'm O
craving O
for O
Pho B
Lemon B
grass I
chicken I
or O
Beef B
Cube I
on I
rice I
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O

Oh O
yes O
and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
fan O
of O
Indian O
oldies O
film O
stars O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
portraits B
of O
Indian O
actors O
and O
actresses O
in O
classic O
black O
white O
that O
adorn O
the O
walls O
some O
of O
which O
I O
would O
love O
to O
know O
where O
they O
obtained O

The O
food B
is O
spectacular O
from O
the O
appitizers B
to O
the O
main B
course I
and O
then O
of O
course O
the O
desserts B
WOW O
you'll O
need O
no O
more O

The O
neighborhood O
was O
nice O
though O
so O
check O
out O
another O
restaurant O
instead O

My O
fish B
was O
delicious O
in O
an O
incredible O
curry B
sauce I

If O
you O
are O
in O
search O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
NYC O
deli B
experience O
look O
no O
further O
than O
the O
famous O
and O
historic O
Katz's O
Deli O
down O
on O
the O
Lower O
East O
Side O

Even O
upon O
delivery O
their O
juicy O
pork B
buns I
are O
quite O
good O
  
This O
is O
also O
where O
I O
was O
from O

Everything O
is O
for O
sale O
in O
here O
including O
the O
sculptured O
iron O
statue O
on O
the O
table O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B
food I
but O
terrible O
delivery B

The O
space B
is O
nice O
but O
when O
we O
order O
our O
drink B
we O
were O
in O
for O
a O
surprise O

The O
entire O
place B
and O
the O
treatment O
we O
received O
felt O
as O
a O
conveyor O
belt O

Joe's O
Pizza O
used O
to O
have O
the O
best O
slice B
until O
this O
pizzeria O
opened O
up O

I O
in O
all O
reality O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
off O
Air O
France O
and O
was O
in O
the O
8th O
District O
in O
Paris O

I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
it O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
but O
it O
shouldn't O

And O
they O
provided O
a O
delicious O
dessert B
on O
the O
house O

They O
are O
still O
living O
in O
the O
dark O
ages O
and O
do O
not O
have O
an O
answering O
machine O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B
you O
are O
limited O

The O
food B
is O
amazing O
rich O
pastas B
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B

Food B
was O
very O
good O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O

I O
had O
Lobster B
Bisque I
it O
has O
2 O
oz O
of O
Maine B
Lobster B
in I
it O

I O
am O
Indian O
and O
I O
have O
tried O
many O
Indian O
places O
in O
NY O

Try O
the O
Pad B
Thai I
it's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices B
are O
so O
cheap O

On O
a O
recent O
Saturday O
night O
I O
was O
with O
a O
group O
of O
5 O
at O
the O
Bread O
Bar O

Food B
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O

The O
price B
very O
reasonable O

Dessert B
- O
can't O
be O
missed O
so O
save O
room O

It O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
order O
but O
once O
the O
food B
is O
ordered O
you O
are O
in O
for O
a O
treat O

Take O
a O
good O
sense O
of O
humoran O
American O
express O
card O
with O
no O
limit O
walk O
out O
with O
a O
lollipopgift O
bag O
in O
hand O
and O
enough O
marketing O
materials O
for O
alain O
to O
to O
take O
the O
show O
on O
the O
road O

Ingredients B
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O

It O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
actually O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
my O
food B

I O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
enjoys O
 fine O
cuisine B
at O
reasonable O
prices B

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
NYC O
and O
I O
only O
wish O
it O
were O
more O
affordable O
so O
I O
could O
go O
more O
often O

The O
staff B
was O
very O
attentive O
the O
ambience B
lovely O
and O
the O
food B
superb O

I O
love O
when O
restaurants O
think O
using O
fancy O
expensive O
ingrediants B
makes O
the O
food B
fine O
cuisine B
even O
with O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
use O
them O

THe O
Pizza B
and O
wine B
were O
excellent-the O
service B
too--but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B
dining I
area I

THE O
FRANKENSTEIN O
SHOW O
WAS O
THE O
BEST O

The O
waiters B
are O
sweet O
the O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
bill B
is O
never O
too O
large O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O

The O
service B
was O
superb O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O

We O
all O
had O
the O
tasting O
menu B
and O
unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
I O
felt O
there O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
food B

It O
only O
took O
about O
five O
or O
so O
minutes O
to O
get O
an O
empty O
table B
but O
standing O
up O
wasn't O
too O
bad O

The O
menu B
may O
be O
small O
but O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
delicious O

Too O
bad O
Latin O

Stumbled O
upon O
this O
gem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
and O
I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
frequently O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy's O
frequently O

- O
for O
dessert B
we O
split O
chocolate B
cake I
and O
vanilla B
gelato I
with I
espresso I
which O
were O
tasty O
but O
I O
thought O
a O
bit O
overpriced O

When O
I O
visited O
my O
friend O
who O
lives O
in O
the O
Upper O
Eastside O
she O
recommended O
that O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O

Warm O
comfortable O
surroundings B
nice O
appointments O
witness O
the O
etched O
glass O
and O
brickwork O
separating O
the O
dining B
rooms I

We O
ran O
a O
little O
late O
for O
the O
reservation B
but O
it O
wasn't O
a O
problem O
to O
get O
our O
table B
immediately O

Kudos O
Haru O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation B
and O
seated O
promptlyThe O

I O
plan O
on O
eating O
here O
more O
often O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
for O
a O
very O
special O
occasion O
but O
not O
for O
regular O
fine O
dining B

The O
well O
mannered O
pleasant O
staff B
that O
Tony O
has O
in O
his O
employ O

The O
flavors B
robust O
and O
subtle O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
$2 O
pints O
during O
happy O
hour O
and O
the O
some O
of O
the O
cheapest O
oysters B
you'll O
find O
in O
the O
city O
though O
the O
quality B
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O

I O
would O
never O
wait O
for O
a O
table B
to O
eat O
it O
just O
is O
not O
THAT O
great O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B
chocolate I
cake I
both O
were O
delicious O

The O
counter B
service I
is O
bad O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O

Service B
here O
was O
great O
food B
was O
fantastic O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
peaceful O
place B
to O
eat O
outside O

and O
we O
were O
thouroughly O
disapointed O

This O
is O
the O
Jackel O
and O
Hideof O
the O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UES O

The O
sauce B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
crust B
is O
perfect O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O

Since O
my O
first O
dinner B
I O
have O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
have O
brunch B
at O
Orsay O
3x O

You O
will O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
decore B
but O
the O
food B
is O
no O
better O
or O
worse O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
Chinese O
and O
Asian O
fusion O
places O
in O
NY O

They O
have O
some O
great O
entrees B
here O
as O
well O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
too O

The O
service B
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
-- O
just O
decent O

The O
food B
served B
in O
small O
tasting O
portions B
as O
an O
option O
is O
very O
good O
with O
each O
dish B
being O
better O
than O
the O
next O

You O
guys O
are O
awesome O

They O
do O
cater B
to O
American O
palates O
but O
if O
you O
like O
it O
hot O
let O
them O
know O
and O
they O
are O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
oblige O

I O
loved O
this O
place O

I O
had O
the O
mango B
chicken I
and O
i O
can't O
go O
on O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
delicious O
that O
was O
and O
the O
presentation B
was O
beatiful O

I O
care O
more O
about O
the O
food B
and O
ambience B

Oh O
but O
wait O
we O
were O
out O
of O
drinks B
which O
were O
also O
delightfully O
overpriced O

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
for O
any O
occasion O

The O
service B
is O
fantastic O

I O
recommend O
that O
you O
try O
this O
hidden O
spot O
which O
will O
surely O
blowup O
very O
soon O

The O
garlic B
mashed I
potatoes I
are O
hands O
down O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O

Food B
and O
service B
was O
okay O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O

The O
lamb B
meat I
was O
under-cooked O
and O
EXTRMELY O
CHEWY O

The O
best O
pad B
thai I
i've O
ever O
had O

Over O
time O
the O
food B
quality I
has O
decreased O
substantially O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
crowded O
than O
it O
used O
to O
and O
the O
service B
must O
definitely O
be O
part O
of O
the O
reason O

Great O
pizza B
and O
fantastic O
service B

We O
were O
seated O
outside B
and O
the O
waiter B
spilled O
red B
wine I
and O
hot B
tea I
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil B
next O
time O

While O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
place B
in O
that O
overly O
cute O
French O
way O
the O
food B
was O
insultingly O
horrible O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O

I O
really O
didn't O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
literally O
overlooks O
the O
main O
hall O
of O
Grand O
Central O

None O
of O
that O
yucky O
whipped O
stuff O

The O
wine B
list I
isn't O
great O
and O
the O
desserts B
are O
shipped O
in O
from O
Bruno's O
down O
the O
street O
which O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O

I O
ordered O
a O
Lassi B
and O
asked O
4 O
times O
for O
it O
but O
never O
got O
it O

Their O
coffee B
is O
quite O
good O
too O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O

great O
wine B
list I
italian O
good O
food B
service B
was O
INITIALLY O
fine O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
space B
is O
large O
they've O
overcrowded O
the O
floor O
with O
tables B

i O
know O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O

As O
far O
as O
the O
service B
goes O
the O
waitresses B
were O
not O
particularly O
friendly O
but O
they O
got O
the O
job O
done O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place B
but O
also O
become O
hostile O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish B
Ive O
requested O

Normally O
that O
would O
be O
improper O
however O
they O
were O
all O
delicious O
and O
my O
host B
did O
not O
complain O

Taxan B
delicious O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
an O
off O
night O
but O
it O
was O
suprisingly O
average O
for O
a O
93 O
rating O

Unlike O
other O
places O
in O
NYC O
where O
the O
sandwiches B
you O
want O
only O
come O
as O
a O
triple-decker O
here O
you O
can O
get O
what O
you O
want O
in O
a O
reasonably-sized O
portion B
and O
price B

Southern B
Indian I
cuisine I
is O
still O
there O
too O

Restaurant O
snobs O
need O
not O
bother O
this O
is O
a O
small O
neighborhood O
kind O
of O
place B

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O

They O
couldn't O
even O
make O
a O
salad B
that O
was O
appealing O

For O
two O
people O
with O
tip B
was O
less O
than O
$25 O
bucks O

Killer O
Sushi B

Of O
course O
the O
reason O
its O
so O
packed O
is O
because O
the O
food B
is O
so O
delicious O

Staffs B
are O
not O
that O
friendly O
but O
the O
taste B
covers O
all O

The O
jukebox B
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O

And O
I've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O

This O
place O
is O
always O
packed O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O

Plus O
they O
made O
a O
perfect O
martini B

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
call O
the O
food B
here O
Indian O
as O
it O
is O
a O
fusion O
of O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
French O
with O
an O
Indian O
or O
exotic O
touch O

I've O
eaten O
thai O
many O
times O
and O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B

The O
waiter B
was O
attentive O

Their O
Margarita B
is O
best O
I've O
had O
since O
I've O
returned O
from O
Naples O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant O
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O

The O
tastes B
makes O
your O
mouth O
water O
for O
more O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O

Their O
sake B
list I
was O
extensive O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple B
Haze I
which O
wasn't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O

The O
tables B
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
the O
menu B
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
and O
the O
wine B
list I
is O
simply O
overpriced O

All O
in O
all O
a O
wonderful O
experience O
can't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O

The O
food B
was O
actually O
aweful O

after O
dining O
at O
BOG O
over O
twenty O
times O
now O
its O
official O
 
They O
are O
served B
with O
a O
free O
appetizer B
and O
the O
portions B
are O
perfect O
for O
lunch B

There O
is O
actually O
space B
to O
breathe O
and O
the O
decor B
sets O
the O
tone O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner B

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B
was O
great O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak B
medium O

Furthermore O
the O
rice B
had O
no O
seasoning B
so O
the O
sushi B
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O

This O
place O
has O
realy O
fresh O
sushi B
and O
a O
nice O
large O
menu B
of O
Japanese B
classic I
cuisine I

The O
sushi B
is O
average O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
anything O
but O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
also O
enjoyed O
the O
spinach B
the O
Shanghai B
low I
mein I
and O
other O
attractions O

Owner B
must O
have O
coem O
on O
this O
website O
to O
give O
himself O
credit O

Turned O
out O
there O
was O
full O
service B
upstairs O
and O
sat O
down O

I O
would O
go O
back O

Definitely O
will O
be O
back O

Several O
of O
the O
dim B
sum I
orders I
had O
about O
6-8 O
pieces O

I'm O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O

they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
thai O
way O
of O
living O

If O
you O
have O
a O
dumpling B
fetish O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
here O

Three O

one O

and O
horedevous B

The O
food B
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
- O
I've O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
the O
owner B
has O
always O
been O
accomodating O
and O
friendly O

The O
waiters B
and O
owners B
were O
nonchalant O
about O
this O
and O
promised O
to O
call O
the O
exterminator O
but O
weren't O
as O
dismayed O
or O
apologetic O
as O
I O
would O
have O
expected O

I O
live O
nearby O
and O
when O
they O
first O
opened O
I O
ate O
there O
a O
lot O

And O
the O
food B
was O
fantastic O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
down O
have O
a O
drink B
and O
conversations O
with O
friends O
go O
to O
sweet-n-tart O
and O
order O
yourself O
a O
hong-kong B
styled I
milk I
and O
tea B

pearls I
hot I

Aside O

also O
friendlier O
here O
especially O
the O
owner B
Kenny O

While O
the O
room B
is O
not O
particularly O
comfortable O
once O
you're O
seated O
you'll O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
what's O
on O
your O
plate B

I've O
lived O
in O
NYC O
all O
my O
life O
and O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
so O
many O
waterbugs B
in O
one O
place O
except O
in O
a O
really O
bad O
dream O

Winnie O
and O
her O
staff B
are O
the O
best O
crew B
you O
can O
find O
serving B
you O

The O
ambiance B
is O
minimal O
the O
food B
is O
not O
phenomenal O
but O
some O
dishes B
are O
quite O
good O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B
parmesan I
veal B
in I
carozza I
chicken I
saltimbocca I

My O
host B
asked O
for O
appetizers B
for O
the O
group O
and O
the O
waiter B
gave O
us O
not O
only O
what O
we O
ordered O
but O
some O
other O
items O
that O
were O
not O
ordered O

You O
can O
even O
get O
packages O
of O
the O
chutneys B
to O
stock O
your O
fridge O

The O
bar B
has O
various O
selections O
and O
the O
mixed B
drink I
special I
is O
a O
catcher O
2 O
for O
1's O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O

If O
it O
isn't O
for O
the O
food B
A+++ O
it O
must O
be O
the O
service B
or O
the O
ambience B

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
the O
chef B
and O
staff B
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B
it's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant O

We O
were O
exploring O
Grand O
Central O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
food O
court O

Overall O
not O
worth O
the O
money B

This O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B

We O
left O
after O
one O
drink B

Everything O
that O
happened O
was O
not O
even O
up O
to O
mediocre O

Our O
last O
time O
there O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
was O
early O
at O
5pm O
and O
it O
was O
very O
crowded O
and O
noisy O

Pick O
a O
bagel O
has O
the O
best O
bagels B
in O
the O
city O

You O
are O
paying O
for O
the O
atmosphere B
which O
is O
nice O
but O
can O
be O
had O
in O
numerous O
places O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O

It's O
called O
Gnochi O
alla O
nona O
and O
is O
found O
under O
Chef O
Specials O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O

Yes O
you O
have O
to O
wait B
to O
be O
seated O
and O
because O
its O
small O
there O
is O
no O
waiting B
area I
and O
the O
seat B
at O
the O
bar B
was O
all O
taken O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
 I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
and O
the O
spice B
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor B
of O
the O
dish B

The O
fried B
dumplings I
are O
GREAT O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B
ribs I
in O
the O
city O

Ive O
been O
here O
so O
many O
times O
the O
waiters B
know O
my O
name O

The O
decor B
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O

I've O
been O
frequenting O
The O
Tasting O
Room O
since O
it O
first O
arrived O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
and O
I've O
never O
been O
disappointed O

We O
figured O
we O
never O
had O
Argentinian B
Pizza I
before O
so O
we O
grabbed O
our O
lunch B
there O
sharing O
a O
large O
Pelligrino B
a O
pizza B
of O
two O
of O
their O
specials O
one O
was O
goat B
cheese I
the O
other O
blue B
cheese I
and O
both O
were O
excellent O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
start O
or O
finish O
your O
day O

The O
'kamasutra' O
and O
'bombay O
cosmopolitan' O
are O
excellent O
and O
will O
have O
you O
tipsy O
in O
no O
time O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date B
spot I
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O

The O
dim B
sum I
here O
is O
only O
so-so O

It O
was O
raining O
and O
we O
figured O
why O
not O

$6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
good O
food B

Another O
welcome O
addition O
to O
the O
neighborhood O

Seating B
is O
ok O
even O
though O
sometimes O
there's O
alot O
of O
people O

This O
time O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
into O
detail O

Even O
with O
a O
relatively O
inexpensive O
botle B
of I
wine I
if O
you O
can O
call O
$7000 O
inexpensive O
the O
cost B
is O
through O
the O
roof O
for O
better O
than O
average O
fare O

Service B
was O
slow O
but O
the O
people B
were O
friendly O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O

The O
steak B
was O
very O
fatty O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
overpowering O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O

My O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
are O
literally O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
the O
people O
next O
to O
you O

And O
affordable O

The O
staff B
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
WONDERFUL O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O

The O
food B
is O
alright O
- O
some O
stuff O
is O
good O
- O
some O
is O
not O
like O
the O
steak B
dish I
which O
tends O
to O
be O
dry O

Not O
only O
would O
I O
not O
recommend O
Jimmy's O
restaurants O
to O
friends O
I O
would O
strongly O
suggest O
they O
go O
anywhere O
but O

They O
have O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B
so O
its O
something O
for O
everybody O

Haru O
on O
Park O
S O
is O
simply O
disgusting O

The O
staff B
was O
too O
busy O
ordering O
sushi B
for O
dinner B
and O
then O
laying O
it O
out O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
bar B
to O
even O
bring O
me O
my O
check B

As O
a O
long-time O
patron O
of O
Mamoun's O
I O
always O
figured O
that O
I O
had O
found O
the O
best O
late O
night O
food B
spot I
in O
the O
city O

I O
drop O
more O
dollar O
bills O
here O
than O
your O
uncle O
after O
a O
weekend O
at O
Scores O

The O
bagel B
was O
huge O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O
like O
your O
somewhere O
else O

Get O
the O
tuna B
of O
gari O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B
chai B
and O
the O
chole B
but O
the O
dhosas B
and O
dhal B
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O

It O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
surprise O

Edible O
but O
really O
a O
ripoff O
at O
those O
prices B
given O
whats O
in O
the O
area O

The O
staff B
has O
been O
nice O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom B
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O

I O
am O
French O
and O
I O
really O
felt O
like O
home O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir O
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O

The O
service B
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant O

It's O
usually O
packed O
for O
good O
reason O
esp O

Service- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O

I O
love O
going O
there O

I O
cannot O
recommend O
OG O
more O
highly O
if O
I O
tried O
- O
check O
it O
out O
for O
yourself O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place O
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O

Service B
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O

Great O
food B
great O
decor B
great O
service B

And O
atlhough O
tables B
opened O
up O
next O
to O
us O
and O
we O
ASKED O
for O
a O
slightly O
larger O
space B
they O
left O
us O
awkardly O
seated O

The O
palak B
paneer I
was O
standard O
and O
I O
was O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
malai B
kofta I

I've O
dined O
at O
Alain O
Ducasse's O
restaurant O
in O
Monte O
Carlo O
for O
half O
the O
price B
for O
the O
same O
excellent O
dining B
experience O

Yeah O
sometimes O
the O
service B
can O
be O
slow O

There O
was O
no O
ambiance B

Save O
your O
money O
and O
don't O
waste O
your O
calories O
go O
to O
Margharita's O
on O
Washington O
Street O
instead O
they O
have O
amazing O
food B
and O
the O
BEST O
service B

The O
service B
was O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O
and O
each O
dish B
we O
tried O
was O
wonderful O
from O
the O
spring B
rolls I
to O
the O
cod B
with I
pineapple I
tempura I

But O
trust O
me O
it O
is O
so O
worth O
it O

It O
is O
not O
a O
place O
for O
tourists O
or O
someone O
who O
has O
never O
dined O
in O
Bay O
Ridge O

THe O
perfect O
spot O

The O
only O
weird O
thing O
was O
if O
we O
got O
a O
bottle B
the O
waitress B
would O
have O
simply O
multiplied O
the O
glass O
price B
X4 O
which O
makes O
no O
sense O
whatsoever O

They O
sell O
special O
sushi B
everything O
have O
a O
topping B
sauce B
and O
etc O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste B

They O
never O
came O
back O
to O
refill O
our O
glasses O
again O

The O
place B
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
but O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
and O
it's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
a O
romantic O
date O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O

The O
service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O

Service B
was O
also O
very O
good O

I O
took O
my O
girlfriend O
there O
for O
her O
birthday O
last O
night O
and O
we O
had O
a O
relaxing O
really O
good O
meal B

I O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
disappointed O
with O
the O
portions B
if O
the O
qualities B
were O
good O
enough O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
but O
they O
were O
not O

They're O
rude O
at O
times O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O

I'm O
happy O
to O
have O
Nosh O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
the O
food B
is O
very O
comforting O

Good O
atmosphere B
combination O
of O
all O
the O
hottest O
music B
dress B
code I
is O
relatively O
strict O
except O
on O
Fridays O

They O
kindly O
brought O
us O
more O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
better O
but O
it O
was O
not O

love O
the O
food B

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
Nina's O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
have O
a O
romantic O
dinner B
in O
a O
heart O
warming O
surrounding B
filled O
with O
candles B
and O
family O
pictures B

All O
the O
desserts B
the O
group O
tried O
got O
favorable O
reviews O

There's O
something O
smooth O
about O
sipping O
sake B
upper O
east O
side O
style O

It's O
a O
nice O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O

This O
place O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O

Best O

Wonderful O

Going O
to O
Volare O
is O
like O
going O
to O
your O
favorite O
aunt's O
house O
for O
dinner B
assuming O
that O
your O
aunt O
is O
a O
great O
Italian O
cook O

The O
sushi B
has O
been O
from O
average O
to O
below O
average O
the O
wait B
service I
has O
always O
been O
sub-par O
the O
atmosphere B
goes O
from O
nice O
to O
really O
irritating O
if O
you O
sit O
in O
the O
area B
beyond O
the O
kitchen O
the O
acousitcs O
are O
horrid O
everything O
echoes O
is O
extremely O
loud O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O

Frites B

delicious O
if O

in O
Queens O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O

Very O
good O
value O

Here O
you O
get O
the O
zen B
feel I
without O
feeling O
rigid O

I O
would O
recommend O
putting O
your O
name O
down O
and O
then O
getting O
a O
drink B
at O
a O
local O
bar B
first O
though O
because O
of O
the O
wait B
time I

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
egg B
noodles I
in I
the I
beef I
broth I
with I
shrimp I
dumplings I
and I
slices I
of I
BBQ I
roast I
pork I

I O
keep O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
the O
whole O
subway O
ride O
hoping O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
table B
I O
can O
sit O
at O
by O
myself O
and O
not O
have O
to O
share O
with O
the O
rice B
congee I
soup I
people O

Overall O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
town O

Everything O
a O
NY O
pizza O
joint O
should O
be O

It O
was O
huge O
delicious O
fresh O
and O
will O
be O
the O
reason O
we O
return O

We O
go O
often O

Light O
refreshing O
summer B
rolls I
not O
fried O
remind O
me O
of O
Vietnamese O
places O
in O
Paris O

The O
sushi B
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O

moral O
stay O
away O

but O
the O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O

Spreads B
and O
toppings B
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O

When O
I O
saw O
that O
their O
website O
had O
a O
link O
to O
da O
Ciro O
in O
Napoli O
I O
knew O
there O
was O
going O
to O
be O
good O
pizza B

No O
one O
asked O
what O
was O
wrong O
as O
we O
left O
with O
nothing O
touched O
on O
our O
plates B

Indoor B
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O

We O
had O
a O
3 O
hour O
brunch- O
they O
definitely O
do O
not O
rush O
you- O
and O
they O
kept O
the O
unlimited O
mimosas B
flowing O
the O
whole O
time O

And O
their O
prices B
are O
very O
high O
- O
they O
actually O
think O
that O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with O
charging O
such O
prices B
for O
such O
terrible O
food B
and O
service B

They're O
terrific O

The O
service B
was O
excellent O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
but O
the O
entire O
experience O
was O
very O
cool O

The O
service B
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant O
is O
clean O

Great O
spot B
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B
or O
quiet O
dinner B

Just O
stick O
with O
the O
small O
dishes B

The O
cafe B
itself O
was O
really O
nice O
with O
comfortable O
outdoor B
chairs I
and O
tables B
but O
the O
service B
could O
have O
been O
better O

I've O
rarely O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
slow O
staff B
in O
the O
10 O
years O
I've O
been O
going O

Food B
is O
excellent O

This O
place O
is O
a O
literal O
hole-in-the-wall O
that O
is O
buried O
within O
Doyers O
right O
off O
of O
Pell O
St O
barber's O
alley O
in O
Chinatown O

They O
outshine O
HH O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce B
and O
some O
walnuts B
the O
salads B
we O
got O
were O
great O

Excellent O
lunch B
buffet I
for O
only O
$695 O

We O
were O
sorry O
to O
check O
them O
off O
our O
list O
as O
we O
had O
enjoyed O
and O
recommended O
the O
place O
in O
the O
past O

If O
you're O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B
you O
may O
encounter O
problems O
ordering O
here O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
bring O
plenty O
of O
cash O
with O
you O
as O
they O
don't O
accept O
credit O
cards O

both O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B
around O
$8 O
for O
dinner B
and O
$5 O
for O
lunch B
and O
are O
delicious O
and O
filling O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune O
is O
particularly O
memorable O

Ambience B
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O

The O
portion B
sizes I
here O
are O
huge O
and O
the O
sushi B
is O
good O

Just O
wish O
they'd O
expand O

My O
boyfriend O
ate O
tuna B
and O
it O
was O
cooked O
perfectly O

This O
wasn't O
the O
expected O
menu B
comprised O
only O
of O
pad B
thai I
and O
tom B
yum I
soup I
but O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
what O
made O
the O
place O
so O
special O

Good O
food B
at O
the O
restaurant O
a O
bit O
expensive O
but O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
your O
date O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B
and O
fantastic O
service B

You O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food B
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O

I O
have O
eaten O
there O
3-4 O
times O
and O
the O
food B
was O
always O
good O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait B
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O

great O
eats B
good O
times O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O

Grilled O
whole O
fish B
wonderful O
great O
spicing O

For O
years O
I O
thought O
Tuscan B
cuisine I
was O
the O
best O
but O
Salvatore O
converted O
me O
to O
the O
hearty O
Neapolitan B
fare I
on O
my O
first O
visit O

Plus O
when O
our O
entrees B
were O
held O
up O
in O
the O
kitchen O
on O
a O
busy O
Saturday O
night O
the O
owner B
sent O
over O
complimentary O
summer B
rolls I
to O
hold O
us O
over O

The O
service B
was O
great O
as O
well O

Try O
the O
lobster B
teriyaki I
and O
the O
rose B
special I
roll I

Another O
plus O
is O
most O
of O
the O
entrees B
are O
approx O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
soon O

Loved O
it O

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
relaxed O
and O
we O
have O
now O
adopted O
Plate O
347 O
as O
our O
Secret O
on O
Second O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O

From O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
they O
were O
more O
than O
accomodating O
even O
though O
the O
place B
was O
packed O

It O
is O
LOUD O
HOT O
and O
DARK O

I O
found O
the O
food B
service B
and O
value B
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B

The O
food B
is O
definitely O
good O
but O
I O
left O
a O
bit O
disappointed O

I O
am O
a O
100 O
lb O
girl O
had O
a O
glass B
of I
wine I
and O
a O
glass B
of I
beer I
prior O
to O
the O
dinner B
and O
I O
was O
still O
HUNGRY O
after O
my O
visit O
to O
this O
place O

The O
drinks B
are O
a O
saving O
grace O
but O
service B
staff I
please O
get O
over O
yourselves O

It O
was O
wonderful O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
-- O
the O
delivery B
guys I
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O

The O
all-Italian O
staff B
is O
warm O
and O
engaging O
from O
the O
start O

Village O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
scores O
on O
all O
fronts O

The O
prices B
are O
exceptionally O
reasonable O
for O
food B
of O
this O
caliber O

If O
you O
go O
here O
- O
your O
focus O
should O
be O
the O
Tamarind B
Margaritas I

It O
is O
the O
best O
hidden O
spot O
there O
and O
I O
rave O
about O
it O
to O
everyone O

The O
filet B
mignon I
dish I
was O
superb O

I O
had O
been O
a O
regular O
due O
to O
the O
consistently O
good O
food B
and O
ease O
of O
getting B
a I
table I

Can't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O

This O
place B
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O

The O
food B
is O
good O
I O
can't O
lie O

great O
food B
lt's O
of O
it O
more O
then O
one O
person O
can O
eat O

I O
didn't O
expect O
to O
like O
Nosh O
as O
much O
as O
I O
did O
but O
the O
pastrami B
on I
challah I
sandwich I
I O
had O
was O
otherworldly O
the O
soups B
are O
like O
Mom's O
and O
the O
knishes B
give O
Yonah O
Schimmel's O
a O
run O
for O
its O
money O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
nothing O
special O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables B
at O
most O

This O
place O
is O
worth O
going O
even O
if O
only O
for O
their O
beer B

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B
and O
the O
mahi B
mahi B
on I
saffron I
risotto-yum I

The O
ambience B
was O
so O
fun O
and O
the O
prices B
were O
great O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B
was O
really O
tasty O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B
Go B
Hamburgers I
no I
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O

The O
sandwhiches B
are O
out-of-this O
world O

If O
you O
live O
in O
Upper O
Manhattan O
Siam O
Square O
is O
THE O
place O
for O
Thia B
food I

Decor B
is O
charming O

The O
food B
was O
very O
well O
prepared O

Really O
tasty O
spring B
rolls I
and O
noodles B
for O
a O
good O
price B
though O

Stay O
away O
from O
this O
place O

Good O
because O
hey O
it's O
more O
food B
but O
bad O
because O
dim B
sum I
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
smaller O
portions B
so O
you O
can O
try O
out O
more O
dishes B
and O
smaller O
so O
that O
each O
dish B
is O
cheap O

While O
most O
people O
can O
attest O
to O
spending O
over O
$50 O
on O
drinks B
in O
New O
York O
bars B
and O
hardly O
feeling O
a O
thing O
the O
drinks B
here O
are O
plentiful O
and O
unique O

Complimentary O
stuff B
kept O
coming O
and O
when O
the O
waiter B
saw O
me O
opening O
a O
gift O
I O
received O
my O
dessert B
on O
a O
plate O
that O
had O
Happy O
Birthday O
written O
on O
it O
with O
a O

nice O
touch O
and O
attentive O
staff B

The O
food B
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
I O
called O
cold O
and O
soggy O

If O
you O
go O
for O
the O
pre-theatre B
menu I
it's O
an O
even O
greater O
deal O

The O
one O

Horrible O

Horrible O

Their O

item O
though O
I'm O
not O
sure O
which O
dim B
sum I
dish I
it O
was O

No O
you're O
going O
to O
go O
back O
because O
the O
food B
was O
good O

The O
food B
was O
great O
and O
the O
service B
was O
even O
better O

While O
this O
can O
hardly O
be O
called O
a O
restaurant O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
Manhatten: O
$4 O
for O
a O
plate O
heaped O
with O
rice B
and O
2-3 O
entrees B

Traditional B
French I
decour I
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O

The O
fish B
is O
fresh O
and O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O
perfection O
and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B
chef I
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi B
and O
soy B
sauce I
but O
also O
sometimes O
with O
some O
sea B
salt I

Consequently O
their O
burgers B
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B
and O
they O
were O
huge O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B
Egg I
rolls I

I O
will O
not O
be O
coming O
here O
at O
3am O
again O

Unbelievable O

Very O
good O
wine B
choices I

This O
is O
the O
only O
Thai O
place O
I O
go O
too O
in O
NYC O
it's O
wonderful O
and O
live O
relaxed O
Jazz B
on O
certain O
nights O

We O
will O
be O
back O

We O
were O
seated O
and O
ignored O
by O
waitstaff B

If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
big O
group O
this O
place O
is O
perfect O
because O
it O
recomends O
sharing O
- O
they O
have O
lazy B
susans I
on O
most O
tables B
- O
even O
families O
can O
feel O
comfortable O
here O

They O
showed O
up O
15 O
minutes O
after O
the O
tuna B
melt O

Tasty O
steak B
pork B
loin I
the O
works O

I O
went O
with O
5 O
friends O
and O
we O
lingered O
at O
the O
table B
for O
a O
bit O
and O
didn't O
feel O
rushed O
at O
all O
even O
though O
there O
was O
a O
wait B

I O
went O
to O
Ruby O
Foos O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
enjoyed O
our O
experience O
there O

I'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
-- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B
and O
nice O
service B

The O
burger B
was O
great O
also O

they O
did O
give O
a O
15% O
discount B
at O
the O
end O
wasn't O
enough O
as O
they O
knew O
the O
service B
was O
horrible O

Just O
because O
it's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B
is O
nasty O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O

The O
pizza B
was O
great O

And O
everytime O
I O
go O
there's O
a O
bunch O
of O
drunk O
idiots O
making O
a O
scene O
out O
front O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B
pureed I
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O

however O
it's O
the O
service B
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O

When O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
didn't O
mention O
the O
specials B
he O
didn't O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O

The O
price B
was O
extremely O
reasonable O
for O
the O
appetizers B
and O
food B
we O
ate O

Don't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B
dishes I
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non-veg B
selections I

Kenny O
the O
owner B
is O
always O
there O
and O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O

They O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi B
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place B
is O
consistent O

I've O
had O
to O
wait B
only O
a O
few O
times O
during O
lunch B
but O
this O
place O
is O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait B

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B
was O
above O
average O
and O
I O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners B

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place O
but O
not O
any O
longer O

Delicious O
food B
excellent O
service B
and O
a O
pretty O
atmosphere B
make O
this O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
dinner B
and O
the O
$599 O
lunch B
buffet I
makes O
it O
an O
even O
better O
choice O
for O
lunch B

For O
appetizers B
I O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B
fritters I
and O
dumplings B

And O
cheap O

Such O
nice O
people B
working O
here O
- O
but O
I O
have O
to O
review O
the O
food B

The O
restaurant O
is O
dark O
and O
not O
very O
attractive O
and O
then O
you O
have O
spot B
lights I
shining O
on O
you O
putting O
you O
in O
the O
worst O
light O
possible O
reaching O
for O
sunglasses O

Try O
the O
Times B
Square I
cocktail I
-- O
ginger B
lemonade I
with I
vodka I
also O
available O
without O
vodka O

Nice O
find O

Veal B
Parmigana I
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy's O

Great O
wine B
great O
food B

The O
service B
was O
mediocre O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
air B
conditioning I
made O
for O
a O
less O
than O
comfortable O
meal B

The O
food B
and O
staff B
always O
surprise O
me O
with O
the O
new O
heights O
they O
are O
taken O
to O

Amazing O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza B
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O

I've O
always O
been O
seated O
propmtly O

We O
try O
frequenting O
new O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
but O
any O
time O
that O
we O
 visit O
a O
restaurant O
other O
than O
Roth's O
we O
are O
always O
disappointed O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O

There O
is O
nothing O
more O
pleasant O
than O
that O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
and O
would O
without O
a O
doubt O
come O
again O

However O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price B
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B
you O
can't O
beat O
this O
place O

What O
makes O
this O
restaurant O
special O
are O
the O
authentic O
sichuan B
cooking I
and O
being O
the O
only O
one O
in O
NYC O
that O
offers O
authentic O
chongqing B
hotpot I

Mizu O
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O

For O
sure O
i O
will O
keep O
coming O
back O
because O
i O
feel O
really O
this O
restaurant O
deserves O

Our O
tiny O
table B
for O
two O
dinner B
plates I
hung O
over O
edge O
was O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
one O
of O
the O
lanes O
of O
waiter B
traffic I

Sake B
collection I
was O
excellent O
Try O
Nanbu B
Bijin I
but O
pricy O

Interesting O
other O
dishes B
for O
a O
change O
include O
chicken B
in I
curry I
sauce I
and O
salmon B
caserole I

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

One O
of O
my O
favorites O
though O
was O
the O
Angry B
Lobster I
a O
cold B
lobster I
salad I
that O
was O
magnificent O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

Ask O
for O
Usha O
the O
nicest O
bartender B
in O
manhattan O

The O
service B
is O
outstanding O
and O
my O
crab-cake B
eggs I
benedict I
could O
not O
have O
been O
better O

The O
place's O
decor B
and O
hidden O
bathrooms B
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O

This O
is O
a O
true O
gem O
of O
the O
village O

Its O
location B
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices B
are O
very O
reasonable O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
again O
and O
again O

However O
I O
think O
Jeckll O
and O
Hydes O
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O

They O
treat O
me O
like O
family O
morning O
and O
night O

A O
wonderful O
place B

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place O

Service B
was O
on O
par O
but O
not O
wonderful O

for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O

Deliveries B
often O
take O
up O
to O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
higher O
than O
most O
other O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
area O

I O
went O
to O
Amma O
after O
a O
friend O
recommended O
it O

I'm O
just O
reading O
some O
of O
these O
reviews O
and O
its O
nonsense O
that O
people O
are O
reviewing O
some O
places O
because O
it O
was O
too O
loud O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
;- O

We O
also O
ordered O
two O
hot B
dogs I
thinking O
they O
would O
be O
pretty O
good O
since O
there O
is O
a O
whole O
section O
on O
the O
menu B
devoted O
to O
them O

please O
don't O
fool O
us O

I've O
had O
the O
chicken B
with I
garlic I
sauce I
chicken B
with I
black I
bean I
sauce O
and O
hunan B
chicken B

Because O
of O
the O
delicate O
thin O
crust B
take-out B
pies I
get O
soggy O
in O
their O
boxes O

I O
suspect O
this O
restaurant O
is O
what O
Rao's O
would O
be O
if O
it O
hadn't O
turned O
exclusive O

The O
dish B
had O
like O
6 O
pieces O
of O
beef B
in O
it O

strike O
up O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
attorney O
next O
to O
you O
or O
with O
the O
local O
union O
worker O
on O
the O
other O
side O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O

We O
got O
in O
line O
and O
were O
served B
while O
in O
line O
a O
bannan B
fritter I

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
little O
too O
spicy O
for O
my O
friend O
which O
you O
can O
couteract O
with O
eat O
more O
rice B
and O
keeping O
water B
on O
hand O

This O
place B
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O

Appetizers B
are O
somewhere O
around O
$7 O
each O
and O
the O
main B
dishes I
are O
between O
$11 O
and O
$16 O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Orsay O
for O
Valentine's O
dinner B

I O
don't O
know O
about O
you O
guys O
but O
when O
I O
go O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
I O
go O
for O
the O
food B
not O
for O
the O
atmosphere B

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone B
with I
chocolate I
chips-good I
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O

A O
gentleman B
maybe O
the O
manager B
came O
to O
our O
table B
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O

Very O
different O
than O
regular O
dimsum O
places O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
many O
years O
and O
have O
dined O
at O
many O
restaraunts O

When O
you O
enter O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
have O
entered O
your O
mom's O
kitchen O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers B

I've O
had O
pizza B
both O
times O
and O
the O
caprese B
salad I
appetizer I

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O

He O
was O
terribly O
thirsty O
after O
the O
meal B
too O

And O
when O
I O
visit O
her O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
eat O
at O
'Ino O
at O
least O
once O
daily O
if O
not O
once O
for O
the O
whole O
trip O

I O
wasn't O
there O
for O
the O
Half-Price B
Saturday I
Night I
Special I
but O
Tuesday O
Night O

In O
fact O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O

There O
was O
a O
small O
group O
of O
us O
looking O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
kinda O
late O
on O
a O
weeknight O
and O
we O
ended O
up O
at O
Pastis O

for O
Meetball O
Night O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food B
and O
the O
value B
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O

They O
are O
opening O

Want O

The O
selection B
changes O
frequently O
but O
the O
basic B
dishes I
are O
always O
available O

We've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O

Get O

soup B
and O

nosh B
pastrami I
sandwich I

$8 O
and O

My O
family O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
last O
night O
for O
our O
annual O
Christmas B
dinner I
with O
the O
family O
members O
who O
would O
rather O
spend O
the O
holidays O
with O
friends O
out-of-town O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels B

We O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
booked O
solid O
and O
no O
other O
table B
was O
available O

The O
restaraurant O
is O
very O
small O
so O
reservations B
are O
a O
must O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O

A O
one O
women O
show O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here O

At O
first O
i O
was O
rolling O
my O
ideas O
of O
yet O
another O
French O
place O
on O
the O
UES O

To O
my O
right O
the O
hostess B
stood O
over O
a O
busboy B
and O
hissed O
rapido O
rapido O
as O
he O
tried O
to O
clear O
and O
re-set O
a O
table B
for O
six O

In O
China O
the O
phrase O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
is O
hot O
and O
loud O

After O
dealing O
with O
subpar O
pizza B
all O
over O
the O
Kensington O
neighborhood O
- O
I've O
found O
little O
toninos O

I O
thought O
this O
place O
was O
totally O
overrated O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur B
rolls I
and O
white B
tuna I
sashimi I

You O
won't O
find O
that O
anywhere O
in O
Manhattan O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O

I O
went O
here O
in O
the O
afternoon O
with O
a O
friend O

Our O
first O
greeting O
when O
we O
entered O
was O
The O
last O
call O
is O
at O
10:15 O

Interior O
was O
so O
so O

I'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B

I O
guess O
the O
way O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
described O
it O
was O
The O
French O
Colonies O

they O
were O
able O
to O
squeeze O
me O
in O
at O
6 O
after O
i O
called O
the O
night O
before O
my O
anniversary O
for O
a O
friday O
night O
reservation B
and O
told O
me O
they'd O
treat O
us O
well O
for O
the O
occasion O

Boy O
was O
I O
wrong O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O

Note O
that O
they O
do O
not O
serve O
beer B
you O
must O
bring O
your O
own O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru's O
Sake O
bar B
because O
Haru's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O

When O
we O
walked O
in O
it O
seemed O
like O
it O
was O
there O
for O
200 O
years O

Ahhh O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
in O
my O
opinion O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O

The O
service B
was O
typical O
short-order O
dinner O
type O

We O
shared O
a O
bottle B
of I
sake I
an O
order O
of O
edamames B
and O
she O
had O
the O
sushi B
plate I
while O
I O
had O
the O
sashimi B

I O
can't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese B
sticks I

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O

From O
the O
appetizers B
we O
ate O
the O
dim B
sum I
and O
other O
variety O
of O
foods B
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
criticize O
the O
food B

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
6:00 O
PM O
the O
restaurant O
was O
practically O
empty O

Each O
table B
has O
a O
pot B
of I
boiling I
water I
sunken O
into O
its O
surface O
and O
you O
get O
platters O
of O
thin O
sliced O
meats B
various O
vegetables B
and O
rice B
and O
glass B
noodles I

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
